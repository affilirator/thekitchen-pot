## What is a Fondue Pot?

This pot has a base that's heated by either a candle or a spirit lamp. It has long-stemmed forks used in consuming the constituents of the fondue pot. 

This pot is essential when you're serving a meal to a small group of people. It has the following main fondue utensils:

- **A Fork/ Skewer.** This is an essential part that comes with a fondue pot. When you buy your fondue pot, you will also get several skewers. The skewers are color-coded to prevent a mix-up and help you identify yours without a hassle.
- **A Plate.** You can have a plate for cooked food and another one for uncooked food. 
- **A Fondue Fork.** The pot comes with a fork that you can use for cooking. You should avoid using this fork for eating since it can become quite hot, and it's easy to spread germs if you do so.

## Types of Fuels for Fondue Pot

A [fondue pot](https://www.recipetips.com/glossary-term/t--36180/fondue-pot.asp) can use different types of fuel. While it was initially designed to use candle and spirit lamp, technology has led to modifications allowing more fuel use. Some of the fondue pot fuels that you can use include:

1\. **Electricity**

Electric fondue pots come with features that enable you to adjust temperatures to suit your recipes. It has a base, bowl, and a temperature knob.

Compared to traditional fondue pots, the electric model is easy to use and convenient. Just plug in and switch on power! It is also safer than the ones that use candles and spirit lamps. 

**2\. Candle-Lit Fondue Pot** 

This is common with dessert fondue pots, which are relatively smaller. They do not require much heat, making candles the ideal heat source. 

If your fondue pot has a bigger dish, using a candle to heat it will be slower, and you may experience uneven heating. As such, go for this option only if your fondue bowl is small. 

**3\. Butane Fondue Burner** 

This model has a small burner tank that stores butane. It is ideal for making cheese fondue, broth, or beef fondue. However, it's high heat content makes it unideal for preparing chocolate fondue. 

**4\. Alcohol Burners Fondue**

Most of the alcohol burners are adjustable. You can adjust the flame and the heat capacity, making it ideal for cooking almost every fondue, including chocolate and cheese. 

**5\. Gel Fondue**

The gel fondue burner uses the same mechanism as butane and alcohol burners. However, it does not produce much heat. As such, it is only ideal when making cheese and chocolate fondue. If making oil or broth recipes, then you should consider other types of burners. 

## Types of Fondue Pots

Fondue pots are made from different materials. The common fondue pot materials available in the market include:

**Enamel Cast Iron**

## How to Use a Fondue Pot 

You can use a fondue pot to prepare different recipes. In this section, we'll detail how to use a fondue pot to prepare three everyday meals.

**Fondue Bourguignon**

This is a technique for using your fondue pot to prepare meat and other raw vegetables in an organic oil (canola, peanut, vegetable, or any other organic oil).

- Clean and dry the meat and vegetables to prevent oil splattering
- Once dry, place all your ingredients in a hot fondue pot
- Add oil and heat it until it becomes hot enough (it should brown a piece of bread in less than 30 seconds)
- Transfer it to its holder and cook the meat/veggies for your desired time

**Cheese Fondue**

A cheese party is phenomenal. It becomes better when you invite your friends to well-prepared cheese fondue. Here's how to achieve that:

- Ensure that you heat cheese fondue properly before you transfer it to the fondue pot. 
- Rub the inner pot with garlic to add flavor. Once you transfer it, keep stirring using a spatula.
- When ready, a crust will be left at the bottom. Scrap the delicious part and serve it to your guests.

We recommend the use of electric fondue to control the temperature adequately. Cheese fondue can be quite delicate, and extreme temperatures will not yield the desired results.

**Chocolate and Dessert Fondue**

To get the best results with chocolate fondue, ensure that you use chocolates with more than 50% cocoa content. 

- Heat your chocolate and cream (mixture) over a double burner and keep stirring
- Once the mixture is uniformly mixed and ready, you should transfer it to the fondue pot and serve.
- Use a small amount of heat to keep the mixture warm for your ideal duration.

Never heat your chocolate directly since it will turn into a lump. Instead, you should always use a double boiler.

## Tips on How to Use a Fondue Pot Effectively

- Initially Use a Stove. At the initial stages of your cooking, you should use your **[stove cooktop](https://thekitchenpot.com/best-induction-cooktop-for-the-money/)** to heat the fondue to the required temperature. Once you achieve the right temperature, you should transfer it to the fondue pot to keep it warm under constant temperature. This applies to all other meals.

- **Use a Trivet.** Placing your fondue pot on a trivet will protect your table from the hot pot and eliminate any chances of fire accidents. 
- **Use Flavorful Beverages to Prepare Fondue.** When preparing your fondue, we recommend that you use dry wines. Avoid water as much as you can. 
- **Limit the Number of People Using One Fondue.** We recommend that you limit the fondue users to four per pot. 
- **Provide a Variety.** You should avoid serving a one-course meal as a fondue. It will be boring and monotonous!
- **Keep the Amount of Food in the Fondue Pot at the Minimum.** Having too much food in the pot will lead to a spattering of oil and broth, which will look awkward.
- **Keep Your Fruits and Vegetables Fresh.** To prevent your fruits from turning brown, we recommend that you squeeze lemon juice and splash it over the veggies. 

The primary reason for having a fondue pot is to have fun. It is best for a party setup or use a small family as the members bond. As such, you should do everything possible to create a friendly environment and limit the number of users per fondue pot to four. 

## **Security Measures When Using Fondue Pot**

When using your fondue pot, you should undertake the following precautionary measures:

- **Keep an Eye on Your Fondue Pot.** You should keep your pot where you can see it. Always be careful when dealing with children -close supervision will be mandatory.
- **Never Use Water to Put Off Fire.** In case a fire erupts, you should never use water since it will only help it spread further. Remember that the fondue pot uses spirit! Instead, you should get a lid to cover the pot, thus denying the fire oxygen. 
- **Never Use a Fondue Fork for Eating.** The fork is entirely meant for cooking. It can get dangerously hot. Additionally, using it will help spread germs, which will be unhealthy.
