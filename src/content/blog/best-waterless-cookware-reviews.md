## **What is Waterless Cooking?**

## **Why is Waterfree Cooking Healthy?**

Like we’ve already indicated, the waterless cooking technique uses its [natural juice](https://www.livestrong.com/article/350652-percentage-of-water-in-fruits-vegetables/). As such, you can be sure that you’ll retain many nutrients and minerals to benefit your body.
