## **Should I Buy Ceramic Knives?**

Well, I want to be brutally honest with this; ceramic knives are not the best. While their functionality is top-notch when they are new, they fade away as they age.

Not to say that there are knives that remain new forever! But, the maintenance requirement may just be the determinant of how well the knife serves you.

If you need to buy a ceramic knife, then it should be to complement your high carbon steel knives. It is ideal for chopping thin pieces of vegetables and dicing.

However, ceramic knives are not made from the same material as your ordinary dinner plate or mug!

In fact, the ceramic material used to make knives is super hard! It comes second after diamond on matters hardness.

It is harder than carbide, titanium, and high carbon steel. 

This [advanced ceramic](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/materials-science/yttrium-oxide) is made out of yttrium oxide and zirconium oxide. A combination of the two compounds creates a stable material called [TTZ](http://www.uniceramusa.com/yscttz.htm) (Transformation Toughened Zirconia).

While this hardness is ideal for superior functionality, it is the exact reason why sharpening ceramic knives is a hassle.

If you are to sharpen the knives effectively, you must grind them on a wheel that’s well coated with diamond dust (the only material harder than TTZ). 

## **Why Sharpening Ceramic Knives is Difficult**

As we’ve previously indicated, the answer on how to sharpen ceramic knives lies in using diamond. Due to its high value, getting a wheel coated with diamond powder is surely not easy.

## **Are Ceramic Knives Dishwasher Safe?**

Well, the knife itself can be cleaned using a dishwasher. However, we do not advise you to use a dishwasher when cleaning any knife.

The dishwasher has jets of high pressurized water which will make the knives clash with other dishes and utensils.

Consequently, you are likely to experience knife chips and breakages. The damage is avoidable since hand washing your ceramic knives is a breeze. 

## **How to Store Ceramic Knives** 

As we’ve already indicated, ceramic knives are relatively brittle. If not well stored, the blades will become blunt fast with a risk of breakages. 

One of the best storage practices is to store your ceramic knives in their protective sleeve (usually from the manufacturer).

If you do not have a protective sleeve, then you will need a storage block. Some of the best ceramic knives storage blocks are made from bamboo, wood, or even plastic. 

These blocks ensure that the knives do not collide with other dishes, thus eliminating the risk of breakages. Even better, the blocks give you easy access to the knives.

The blocks are designed with unmatched versatility for ease of storage. You can choose one that sits on your counter or fits in your kitchen drawer. Even better, there are storage blocks that can be hanged on the wall!
