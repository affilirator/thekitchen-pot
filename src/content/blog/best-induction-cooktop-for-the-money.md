Technology has crept into different spheres of life – and the kitchen is certainly among the [biggest beneficiaries](https://wonderfulkitchens.com.au/kitchen-design/using-modern-technology-kitchens/). The invention of induction cooking is one of the most revolutionary occurrences. It has improved how we prepare our meals immensely.

If you lay your hands on the best induction cooktop for the money, then you can be sure that you’ll never look back.  

But what exactly is an induction cooktop? How does it work?

Well, these questions may sound sophisticated now, but you’ll get every bit of its working rationale by the time you’re through with reading this comprehensive guide.

## **What is Induction Cooking** 

[Induction cooking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Induction_cooking) refers to a cooking technology that uses electromagnetic currents to heat the pans directly. 

Unlike traditional cooking, this method does not rely on conduction, convection, or radiation to heat your food. Consequently, heating occurs faster, thus resulting in a quicker cooking process. 

However, you must have the **[best cookware for induction cooktops](https://thekitchenpot.com/blog/best-cookware-for-induction-cooktop//)** to ensure that you enjoy these benefits. Such cookware must have magnetic properties – a magnet should stick on the surface effortlessly.

The **ideal cookware are made of stainless steel and iron**. However, you should note that **not all stainless steel cookware are magnetic**.

## **How Does Induction Cooking Work?**

Induction cooking is an efficient, quick, and convenient way of making your meals. Just like the name suggests, the technique relies on induction heating of your cookware as opposed to the use of thermal conduction, radiation, or convection. 

To achieve the induction, your best induction cooktop for the money must have a coil of copper wire that’s usually under the cookware. Alternating electric current will pass through the wire, which will result in an oscillating magnetic field. 

The magnetic field will in turn induce an electrical current that will heat the cooking vessel.

Also, the cookware must be thick enough to offer sufficient resistance to current flow, thus resulting in better and faster heating. 

If you only own aluminum and copper cooking vessels, then you cannot use your best induction cooktop for the money.

As such, shopping for the cooktop must always be accompanied by a budget for the ideal stainless steel, carbon steel, enameled, and cast iron cookware.

## **Best Induction Cooktop for the Money – Buying Guide** 

Buying the best induction cooktop for the money is not a walk in the park. It requires intensive research since it’s a long term investment. 

Now that we’ve looked at various options available to you depending on your budget, let’s look at all the features you should consider before settling for the best induction cooktop for the money.

### **How Induction Cooktops Work – Backed by Science**

The working rationale of your best induction cooktop for the money is pretty straightforward. It uses the **concept of [Magnetic Induction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_induction)** to generate heat instantly. 

For your induction cooking to be effective, you must have the following two necessities:

-   An induction cooktop
-   An [**induction cookware**](https://thekitchenpot.com/blog/best-cookware-for-induction-cooktop//) 

An induction cooktop has a coil (made of copper) through which electric current passes. This will produce eddy currents.

**But what exactly are Eddy currents?** 

Well, I will save you the jargon and explain this in a simple-to-understand language. 

When an electric current passes through the coil, it creates a magnetic field. If the current is AC (most electricity current is alternating), the magnetic field will constantly change direction in rhythm with the alternating current (AC).

If you have an electric conductor (the induction cookware) placed on the quickly alternating magnetic field, the magnetic lines will penetrate the cookware. **This will create the Eddy Currents.** 

Due to the resistance of the material (the cookware), the Eddy currents will produce heat. This explains the need to have good conductor induction cookware if you need to achieve the best results with this appliance.  

> Only ferrous materials will produce Eddy current when they come into contact with an alternating magnetic field. As such, make sure that you evaluate the ability of any cookware to conduct electricity before buying it.

### **How to Choose the Best Induction Cooktop for the Money**

When you step out to buy the best induction cooktop for the money, there are several factors you should consider. This way, you’ll be guaranteed of getting one that’s within your budget yet highly effective.

However, you can be sure that getting the best induction cooktop will set you a few hundred bucks. Never be too excited with questionably cheap deals, since buying this appliance is a long term investment. 

I would advise that you invest in it and get all the features you need and durability as a bonus.

If that sounds tricky, then you shouldn’t worry. This section will offer a comprehensive analysis of all the details you should know before settling for your best induction cooktop for the money.

### **Factors to Consider When Shopping for the Best Induction Cooktop for the Money**

-   **What Type of Induction Cooktop is the Best for You?**

Answering this question will narrow down your choices making it easy for you to choose the best induction cooktop for the money. 

There are 3 main types of induction cooktops to consider, including:

1. **Portable Cooktop**

Buying the best portable induction cooktop should always be a priority if you love outdoor cooking adventures. 

The cooktops may contain single or multiple burners. The more burners it has, the bulkier it will be. 

2. **Built-In Cooktops**

Built-in cooktops are big and can measure up to 41 inches! Additionally, they have many burners offering the convenience of cooking many meals concurrently. 

The downside of these cooktops is that they are not portable and may require quite a substantial kitchen space to fit in. As such, you must always ensure that you have enough storage space before buying one. 

Additionally, you may require to engage an installation professional if you have no prior installation experience. This comes with added costs. 

3. **Full-Size Induction Cooktops**

These are freestanding induction ranges that have both induction cooktops and ovens. While they are relatively pricey, these cooktops are highly efficient and classy. Some may come with two ovens for guaranteed versatility.

An ideal freestanding induction cooktop should be 30-36 inches. As such, you must always ensure that you have adequate space for storage. 

**[Read more about Freestanding Electric Ranges](https://thekitchenpot.com/blog/best-slide-in-electric-range//) for your consideration**

Additionally, you should consider the electricity requirements of the range (150V to 240V is ideal). They may have a wattage of 1800 to 3700 watts per unit. This can either be split among the burners or fixed for each burner. 

For easy cleaning, many homeowners prefer silver or black induction ranges. But you can choose a white one if you love bright colors. 

-   **Power Sharing – Consider the Wattage**

If you want an induction cooktop that comes with more than 2 burners, then you should understand how they share power. 

While some have equal energy going to all burners, others will have some getting less. For example, one may have 600 watts while the other one has 1200 watts. 

Overall, the temperature and wattage settings depend on the specific brand. As such, you should first check these settings before settling for a specific brand. Most of the ranges can achieve temperatures of 100-450 degrees Fahrenheit. 

Most portable double and single cooktops have 1800W, which is enough to help you accomplish your cooking without a hassle. 

> Most manufacturers indicate the TOTAL wattage of the cooktop. If it’s written 1800 watts, it means that when using two burners, it can only achieve 900W each. In some cases, the burners may have different wattage. For example, 1200W and 600W. 

As such, you should check whether your best induction cooktop for the money has wattage for specific burners or the total wattage will be split when using all the burners. 

-   **Which Induction Cooktop Design is Best for You?**

The ease of using your best induction cooktop for the money depends on its design. It should be compatible with the available kitchen space without leading to congestion. 

The cooktops come in either frame or edgeless design. Almost all portable induction cooktops have a unique housing, a control panel, and a ceramic/glass surface. 

For the edgeless, the cooktop lacks edges and it appears like a smartphone. The control panel is almost the same level as the cooking surface. 

Whichever design you choose, just ensure that the control panel is easily accessible. Also, ensure that the design meets all your needs adequately. 

### **Other Crucial Features that Determines the Efficacy of an Induction Cooktop**

While induction cooking will revolutionize your cooking, you must always ensure that it has the following crucial features to achieve the best results:

-   **Timer Settings**

Having an induction cooktop with accurate timer settings is a plus. It allows you to set the exact time that you want your meals to cook. As such, you’ll eliminate the risk of overcooking.

Even better, this setting is highly convenient. Once you set it up, you can continue working on other chores. When the time is up, the cooktop will shut down automatically. This guarantees safety. 

-   **Easy-to-Understand Preset Menus**

While not all induction cooktop comes with preset menus, we recommend that you look for one with the settings. 

The menus help you to use the appliance as a beginner. It has several cooking functions such as boil, fry, grill, milk, and stir. You only choose that which matches your needs, thus eliminating the chance of burning and guaranteeing well-cooked meals. 

-   **Voltage Display**

This feature is tailor-made to enable you to monitor your daily electrical consumption. If you want to save on electricity, your best induction cooktop for the money should work effectively with low voltage. 

However, you should note that the amount of voltage for the appliance can affect the functionality of your induction cooktop. For example, an induction cooktop with 600 watts will be slower than one with 1800 watts. 

-   **Automatic Pan Detection** 

This is an important safety feature. If your best induction cooktop for the money has the feature, it will detect the pan and start heating. Once you remove it, the heating will be turned off.

Most of the cooktops will shut off 60 seconds after removing your cookware. This will save energy. 

This feature coupled with the auto-switch feature ensures that you avoid overheating your burner or even overcooking your meals. 

-   **Safety Sensors and Child Lock**

Safety should always be a priority in your kitchen! We recommend that you shop for a cooktop that’s connected to WI-FI or any other smart device. This way, all safety concerns will be relayed in real-time to your smart gadget. 

Additionally, an induction cooktop with a child lock feature will ensure that your children are safe in the kitchen. 

When you lock the cooktop, the cooking will continue but all the other features will be disabled, except for the Power Off button.

-   **Small Item Detection**

What happens when your child places a fork/spoon on your cooktop’s burner? Wouldn’t it start heating causing immense risk?

Well, all these fears will be alleviated if your best induction cooktop for the money has small item detection features.

This unique feature ensures that power output will only be available when relatively large cookware is placed on the burner.  

### **What are the Pros and Cons of an Induction Cooktop?**
