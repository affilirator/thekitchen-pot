## Choosing the Best Cycling Balaclava for Winter

![best balaclava for winter](images/best-balaclava-for-winter-1024x679.jpg)

### Warmth

Have you ever tried to ride your bike in the morning or on a cold day?

The most likely answer is that you didn‚Äôt enjoy that ride. Why do you think that is? It is simple; you were losing too much heat. You can easily solve that by always having the best cycling balaclava with you. When you wear a cycling balaclava during your morning rides you are more likely to enjoy the rides than you would if you only had a helmet.

The best cycling balaclavas are made of different textiles depending on the price and intended use. Cheap models are made of inexpensive polyester while premium models are made from high-quality synthetics.

Your choice will depend on the level of cold and your budget. For example, balaclavas made of nylon and microfleece materials offer better wicking, while those made from thermodynamic materials tend to be pricier.

### Breathing Access (Balaclava with Nose Opening)

![Balaclava with Nose Opening](images/Balaclava-with-Nose-Opening.jpg)

If you buy a biking balaclava that is not intended for heavy cycling you might experience breathing issues. It is imperative that you purchase the best balaclava for winter as it is designed for heavy breathing. Such balaclavas come with a nose opening

Balaclavas are designed in different ways; some have a large opening for the eyes, nose, and mouth while others have a hinged mouthpiece and nose. Although balaclavas with a large opening are good for breathing they are not good for warmth purposes as they leave your face open.

The best choice here is the hinged nose and mouthpiece balaclavas as they protect your nose and mouth from cold. The hinged part also makes it easy for you to pull down the opening for easy breathing.

Other designs include mouth panels and mesh nose fitted with breathing vents. While these types of cycling balaclavas look good, they are not the best option for breathing. There is also no room to wipe your nose.

### Cycling Balaclavas with Wicking Properties

Balaclavas with wicking materials are highly recommended as they do a good job in keeping your skin dry even when you sweat. Wicking materials are designed to absorb moisture from your skin and push the moisture outside the fabric. Once outside, the moisture evaporates into the atmosphere leaving your skin dry.

Fabrics such as cotton are good at absorbing liquids but unlike wicking fabrics, cotton does not push the liquid outside. Instead, the fabric remains wet making your morning or winter rides uncomfortable.

### Bike Balaclavas Alterability

Some balaclavas are stationary, which means they cannot be rearranged while others are stretchy and adjustable. Here your choice will depend on your likes and preferences. However, most cyclists tend to prefer the adjustable version as it is adjustable for easy breathing.

You can also opt for the ‚Äúhinged‚Äù balaclavas as they designed with a garment that can be raised or lowered for heat retention or easy breathing.

### Using Glasses With Your Cycling Balaclava

While most cyclists want to ride with glasses, not all balaclavas are designed to fit glasses. Finding a perfect match is not easy. You glasses are most likely to get foggy as the heat trapped by your balaclava is translated to your glasses as moisture.

If it is absolutely necessary for you to wear glasses when cycling, you can purchase [cycling glasses](https://mtbnz.com/best-cycling-sunglasses/) especially those that are fitted with air vents.

### Eye Exposure

Some cycling balaclavas feature two separate apertures for better heat retention while others have a wide aperture as it allows for a better or clear line of vision.

\[su\_divider top="no" divider\_color="#021515" size="1" margin="10"\]

#### What is the Purpose of a Balaclava

Cyclists wear balaclavas to keep their faces warm. The best biking balaclavas are made from thermal fabrics that keep them conveniently warm. However, you should also consider the comfort of the balaclava. For the best feeling on your face and neck, choose woolen balaclavas.
