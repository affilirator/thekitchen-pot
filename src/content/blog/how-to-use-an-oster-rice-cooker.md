**What You Will Need**

-   Rice
-   Water
-   Measuring Cup (preferably one that comes with the rice cooker)
-   [Spatula](https://thekitchenpot.com/blog/best-metal-spatula-set//)

If you’re new to automated rice cooking and you’re wondering how to use an oster rice cooker, then you shouldn’t worry any longer.

Using an oster rice cooker is a straightforward process that you’ll complete without a hassle. Even better, the manufacturer includes a highly comprehensive user’s guide for your reference. 

Since the guide may contain overly detailed processes, we’ve simplified the entire process into easy-to-follow steps. They include:

-   **Rice Measuring** 

Measure the amount of rice that you need to cook. Always ensure that you do not exceed the recommended capacity since that would destroy the pot. 

If you’re wondering on how to know the raw rice you need, then you should always consider this theory:

***1 cup of raw rice = 2 cups of cooked rice***

Once you determine the amount of rice required, you should move on to the preparation phase.

-   **Rice Preparation** 

This is a crucial step that determines the scrumptiousness of your delicacy. Always ensure that you wash your rice and rinse it severally using clean, cold water.

This step is essential since it helps in eliminating excess starch, which would otherwise make the rice stick together making it difficult to cook. 

If you adequately wash your rice, you can be sure that you’ll not experience boiling over situations that would otherwise turn your cooking escapades into a nightmare.

-   **Determine the Water to Rice Ratio**

The amount of water that you need to complete the cooking process successfully determines the type of rice you’re cooking. As a rule of thumb, you should use:

-   1.5 cups of water per 1 cup of white rice
-   2 cups of water per 1 cup of brown or long grain rice

The long grain and brown rice are relatively water-resistant and will thus require more water to cook entirely. 

-   **Place Your Rice in Your Oster Rice Cooker**

Once you’re through with water measuring, you should place it in the cooker and let it soak for approximately 5 minutes. This enhances the cooking process and guarantees fluffier rice.

-   **Close the Lid and Start Cooking** 

Once you plug in your cooker, you will see a red light display which indicates that the rice has started cooking. 

The cooker is pretty fast and you can be sure that you’ll have your meal ready within 15 minutes.

Once ready, the red light will orange. This shows you that the rice is ready but will stay warm until you switch the cooker off.

If you want to enjoy soft rice, you can let it sit in the cooker for another 15 minutes to absorb extra moisture.

When well-used, you can be sure that you’ll preserve the nutrients, color, and the original taste of all your vegetables. 

To use an oster rice cooker to steam your vegetables, you should use the upper tray following these steps:

-   Fill your oster cooker’s inner pot with the right amount of water (approximately 1/3 cupful of water for every 10 ounces of corn, peas, broccoli, and other vegetables). If cooking spinach, you will require 1/3 cupful of water for 5 ounces. The same amount of water is required for 8 ounces of cauliflower and carrots.
-   Once through with water measuring, you should place the inner pot into your oster rice cooker while ensuring that it touches the heating plate. 
-   Cut your vegetables and place them into the steaming tray. 
-   Play the tray on top of the inner pot and ensure that you cover it entirely using a lid
-   Connect your oster rice cooker to your power source and turn it on.
