## Best Sushi Making Kit -Factors to Consider When Buying One

Before you settle for the best sushi making kit, you should consider several factors that can potentially affect its functionality. They include:

1\. **Shapes**

Sushi making kits are available in different shapes. This feature will affect how you implement your recipes. As such, you should be careful to select the shape that will meet your needs.

For example, some sushi kits are designed with unique molds and sushi shapes that will add fun to your cooking. You can find some in different shapes, including hearts, squares, triangles, among many other creative shapes. 

If you’re a dynamic cook that loves trying new things, then you should ensure that your best sushi making kit has tools with different shapes (8 or more different shapes will be ideal)

**2\. Traditional vs. Modern Sushi Making Kits** 

When shopping, you should consider the type of sushi making kit you need. The traditional kits only include a few components that would help you make ordinary sushi without inputting any creativity. They primarily come with a rice paddle and a rolling mat.

While the traditional sushi-making kits are relatively affordable, they lack many features that a modern and exploitative cook would require. Additionally, you can take quite a lot of time before you learn the basics of using them.

On the other hand, modern sushi making kits are relatively pricier and require more storage space. They incorporate different tools for creatively rolling the sushi. The different molds will enable you to make sushi that perfectly matches your needs for any given event. 

**3\. Materials Used in Construction** 

There are two main types of sushi making kits based on materials of construction. They include:

-   Bamboo sushi making kits
-   Plastic sushi making kits 

Most of the traditional sushi-making kits are made from bamboo. However, technological advancement has enabled manufacturers to incorporate features into the sushi kits. You can get kits with plastic accessories.

The plastic ones are sturdy, and you can clean them with much ease, including using a dishwasher. The convenience of use and cleaning has increased the popularity of the plastic ones when compared to the bamboo type. 

***If you choose a bamboo sushi making kit, ensure that it is mold-resistant, easy clean, and dry after every use.***

**4\. Ease of Cleaning** 

If you’d love to **[use a dishwasher to clean](https://thekitchenpot.com/blog/how-to-clean-a-dishwasher//)** your best sushi making kit, then you should ensure that you select the plastic model as opposed to the bamboo ones.

Even then, it would be best if you were keen to check the manufacturer’s cleaning instructions. 

**5\. Kit Size and Components** 

The size of the rolling mat will be similar in most of the kits. However, the other components will vary in size, which will affect how well you use them to make your sushi. 

For example, some kits will come with more than one rolling mat. This will be the best kit if you’re looking for one that can allow many people to roll sushi simultaneously. 

Others will come with extras such as nigiri molds, soy sauce holders, sushi rice, and sushi knives. These extra accessories will help you to become an all-inclusive sushi cooker!

Additionally, the inclusion of many accessories in a kit makes it more inclusive, thus saving the hassle of visiting your store to order ingredients. You can also offer the kit with many accessories as a gift, and the recipient will surely appreciate it. 

**6\. Difficulty Level**

It doesn’t matter how desperate you are to purchase your best sushi kit; never buy one with complicated accessories. There is always a kit that will suit your needs!

If you get more advanced kits, you should ensure that you have the expertise and skills to use it, lest it becomes a waste. 

If you don’t want a simple kit, then you should invest in learning. Read through the manual and watch instructional videos to ensure that you understand everything required of you when you get an advanced sushi making kit. 

**7\. The Nature of Rolling Mats**

A rolling mat is one of the most important constituents of your best sushi kit. As such, you should ensure that you get a quality to ensure your sushi making experience. 

It would be best if you were keen on the mat’s dimensions to ensure that you only choose one that will match your width and length dimension needs.

**8\. Nature of Rice Shaping Tools**

What do the rice shaping tools look like? Are you fine with the shape and the size of the paddle and the spreader? These features are crucial since they will determine the stickiness and the overall quality of your rice. 

**9\. Safety and Innovation**

The best sushi making kit should integrate innovations that will make the sushi-making experience better. Its constituents should be designed ergonomically, to ensure that it’s comfortable in the hands of all users.

Additionally, it would be best if you checked on the safety of the sushi making kits. Ensure that all the components are hand-made and do not have harmful substances that can lead to allergic reactions. 

**10\. The Nature of the Cutting Tools**

Before you settle for your best sushi making kit, you should ensure that its cutters and knives are strong enough and durable. We recommend that you choose ones with porcelain knives. 

**11\. Price**

Once you’ve considered all these factors, you should now consider the price of your best sushi making kit. Is it worth the investment?

Sushi making kits cost between $20 and $50 depending on the constituents, design, and durability. The $20 kits may compromise on quality, which will eventually reduce their longevity.
