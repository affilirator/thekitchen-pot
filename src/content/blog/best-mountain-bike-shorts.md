## How to Choose the best mountain bike shorts

In this section, we are going to focus on some key factors that you should look for when making a purchase decision. They will help you land the perfect mountain biking shorts you’ve been longing for.

### Material

If you want to enjoy high comfort levels when mountain biking, then you must choose a short that has good material. Remember that the type of material will also depend on the season.

If you are planning to use your mountain bike shorts for time trailing or racing, you’ll need an Aero short that is designed to have aerodynamic features in the material. Shorts with this material will help you save energy when riding.

For hot weather conditions, you’ll need to wear shorts whose material is breathable and comfortable. In addition, you should ensure that the material has the ability to wick away sweat.

Make sure that the material is designed to withstand harsh conditions. Besides, it should have water repelling properties that ensures you stay comfortable at all times.

### Padding

To have an enjoyable and comfortable ride, you ought to purchase padded mountain bike shorts. Even though most of shorts will have a liner, it is important to check if they are well padded. Some might have a single layer of padding while others are thickly padded.

The padding layer is popularly known as the chamois. The main reason is because chamois goat leather was a main raw material when making shorts liners.

The Chamois pad is a very important feature of MTB shorts because it acts as a cushion between the saddle and your body. With a good chamois pad, it will be easy to spend a lot of time cycling without experiencing pressure sores.

Always pick a short whose seat pad has seamless stitching, enough cushion and few seams as possible. In case you feel the pad is not enough, you can always use [chamois cream](http://www.cyclingweekly.com/fitness/training/chamois-cream-explained-139014) to regulate the friction.

### Features

When choosing a good pair of mountain bike shorts, you need to consider the variety of features it has to offer. Make sure that each feature will add value during your ride; otherwise, it is good to keep it simple.

One of the key features is deep pockets to help you carry a few items during your ride. You will find that most of the MTB shorts have pockets, but you will find that you do not need them if you have a good [hydration pack](http://mtbnz.com/best-hydration-packs-for-mountain-biking/). During our test rides, we found the Zoic Ether Shorts to have the highest number of pockets which was six. Other shorts have two or four pockets to be precise.

The other impressive feature you need to consider is whether the shorts have an adjustable waist mechanism. An adjustable waist will allow you to snug up the waist for a comfortable fit. My two favorite designs are the Velcro band and the hook and loop design.

The other important feature worth consideration is protection against UV rays. As a cyclist, you have to protect your skin from harmful rays especially when riding for long hours. Choosing a garment that features UV protection will go a long way in keeping your skin safe.

### Durability

Before you buy a mountain biking short, you need to determine whether it will last you for at least a season of serious riding. If the shorts are not designed to last you for long, then do not waste you money on them.

Make sure that the shorts can be machine washed without losing their color. I found out that shorts with thick and abrasion resistant material tend to hold up well in terms of durability.

### Colors

Although color is not an important feature when choosing a mountain bike short, it is important to pick the one that suits you. Shorts are available in different colors; however, it is always good to go for a black one. This is because it does not show dirt even after wiping oily hands on them.

Light colored shorts tend to be a bit expensive but they are not the best choice. They tend to reveal your body when they get wet. Always stick to the black color, it never disappoints!

### Style of Riding

Your style of cycling plays a key role in the kind of bibs or shorts to purchase. If you are looking for shorts that will provide maximum protection during rail trails and Cross-country Mountain biking, choose those with a comfortable fit and gel chamois.

Pro cyclists can choose from some of our handpicked MTB shorts since they all feature a fit that keeps you comfortable at all times. They will prevent you from hot spots and sores all day.

### Size & Fit

Before you add your shorts to your shopping cart, always check that the size is correct. You must ensure that the item does not feel baggy or too tight.  Do not forget to check the length of the inseam too. Experts recommend that the best inseams range from 8” to 9.5”. Comfort is always an essential factor; choose a pair of shorts that does not have irritating stitching. The fact that a short feels good does not imply that it will hold up on the saddle.

## Why Do You Need Mountain Padded MTB Bike Shorts?

They have a unique style that favors trail and MTB riders. These shorts have additions that make them useful for MTB riders. For starters, they feature lightweight nylon fabric that is meant to protect you against branches and the rough experience with ground.

Lycra shorts are so thin that they can’t offer this kind of protection. Incredibly, MTB shorts come with multiple pockets that will help you keep your keys or any other important item. In addition, these shorts also feature efficient cooling events to keep air circulation at maximum levels.

Most of the MTB baggy shorts are fitted with a chamois that acts as a cushion between your underside and the saddle. You’ll find that some of these shorts have a removable liner to make cleaning easier.

Even though most mountain biking shorts will come with zip-secured pockets, it is not good to carry sharp or heavy objects. Also, do not stuff your pockets to the brim if you want a smooth and comfortable ride.

It is always good to pick a mountain bike short that has adjustable and comfortable waist. This way, you will not have any problems adjusting the shorts with gloved hands.  

Most people prefer shopping for ¾ length shorts since they offer extra warmth and knee protection. Be sure to check the fit, otherwise, you might end up buying oversized shorts.

## Conclusion

Bike lovers will agree with me that cycling can never be enjoyable without ensuring that your body stays protected at all times. It is for this reason that you should invest in the best mountain bike shorts since they are designed to enhance your cycling experience. If you follow our buying guide and top ten reviews, you’ll definitely land yourself what you’ve been looking for. Make sure that this article will help you make an informed decision.
