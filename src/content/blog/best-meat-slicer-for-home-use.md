## **Best Meat Slicer for Home Use: Complete Buying Guide**

While using the [best knives](https://thekitchenpot.com/blog/best-knife-set-under-100//) to cut meat can be appropriate, you may require a more versatile slicer. This will save time while increasing cooking efficiency.

If you want to buy the best [meat slicer](https://thedaringkitchen.com/how-to-use-a-meat-slicer/) for home use, then you’re on the right forum. Here, we’ll highlight the crucial factors that you should consider before you settle for your best meat slicer for home use.

### **Blade Type and Size**

The best meat slicer for home use will often come with either smooth-edged or serrated blades. The type of blade you select will largely depend on what you want to cut often.

For example, if you want to cut lean meat and vegetables, you should go for the smooth-edged meat slicer for home use. On the converse, the serrated blade is ideal for cutting hard foods such as frozen meat, cheese, and bread.

> ***You can always get extra blades! This allows you to change the blades depending on the food item you want to cut.*** 

Additionally, you should always consider the blade size before you purchase your best meat slicer for home use. The blades come in 7 inches, 9 inches, and 14 inches size. The bigger it is, the more effective it’ll be—especially when it’s for frequent use.

### **The versatility of your Best Meat Slicer for Home Use**

While your primary focus is cutting meat, you should always consider a meat slicer for home use that can cut other food items.

It must be versatile enough to cut foods such as cheese, vegetables, and other hard cooking items. This way, you’ll have double-benefits when using your best meat slicer for home use.

### **Frequency of Usage**

Your best meat slicer for home use will only serve you optimally if you do not exceed its estimated usage range. For example, if you’re buying it to use daily, you must consider how sturdy the material used is!

### **The Motor/ Engine Power**

The motor size of your best meat slicer for home use determines its efficacy and versatility. A powerful engine is ideal for cutting hard foodstuffs such as frozen meat and cheese.

### **The Noise Levels of Your Best Meat Slicer for Home Use**

While you want to simplify your cooking process, it would be inconvenient if your meat slicer for home use is noisy. As such, you must always consider a considerably quiet meat slicer for home use, without compromising its efficacy.

To achieve this, you should consider the engine transmission system. The two types available include; geared and belted.

While gear-based meat slicers for home use have better output, they tend to be louder than the belt-based meat slicers. Additionally, repairing the gear-based ones may be quite expensive.

On the contrary, the belt-based meat slicers for home use are cheaper, easy to repair, and relatively quieter.

### **Space Availability**

Before buying your best meat slicer for home use, you should consider the space available in your kitchen. You should only buy a meat slicer that’ll not give you storage headaches.

### **Ease of Cleaning**
