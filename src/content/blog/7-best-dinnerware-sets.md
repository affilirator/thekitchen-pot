## **Best Dinnerware Sets – The Best Construction Material**

Different materials are commonly used in the construction of your best dinnerware set. This consideration is crucial since it determines the price, weight, longevity, functionality, and the overall aesthetics of your dinnerware set.  

Here are some of the materials used:

-   **Bone China**

This is one of the most [durable materials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_china) used in the construction of dinnerware sets. It is prepared by adding bone ass to porcelain bone ash to ordinary porcelain. 

The resulting material is lightweight, milky white, and slightly translucent glamor. It offers a luminous glaze that is superbly aesthetic!

However, elegance comes at a cost! Dinnerware sets made from this material are expensive. Also, not all of the bone china cookware is microwave-safe and dishwasher-safe.

As such, you should always read the instructions exhaustively before you settle for your best bone china dinnerware set. 

-   **Porcelain** 

This is a common [materia](https://www.southernliving.com/home/what-is-porcelain)l used in the construction of various cookware equipment. It is relatively affordable than bone china. 

It features a non-porous surface that offers significant durability and ease of cleaning (most of these dishes are dishwasher safe). You can also use porcelain dinnerware sets in a microwave with no worry. 

-   **Melamine** 

This is a plastic material that’s hardened to prevent breaking easily. It is dishwasher safe and highly affordable. 

Even more crucial, the material is BPA-free and meets all FDA recommendations for use in a microwave and with hot meals. 

-   **Stoneware Material** 

This material mimics earthenware: it is heavy and thicker than both bone china and porcelain. It is relatively less durable and can easily break when mishandled. 

If you’re looking for aesthetics and sophistication, then you can consider purchasing the stoneware cookware. They offer a rustic feel with a white appearance coupled with a textured feel. 

Due to their delicate nature, you should only buy a stoneware dinnerware set if you’re capable of taking great care of them.

-   **Vitrified Glass**

This is a glass that has been [heated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitrification) using ultra-high temperature to achieve an opaque appearance. The material is super durable and difficult to break!

However, you should ensure that it does not fall on a hard surface. In such a case, it’ll likely break.

## **Best Dinnerware Sets – Buying Guide**

When buying your best dinner set, you should first evaluate your needs. Different sets come with different dishes (with varying size, shape, color, and capacity). 

As such, the dinnerware set you choose depends entirely on your needs. Here are some of the dishes that may come in the dinnerware package:

-   **Dinner Plate.** This will always be the biggest plate in your best dinnerware set. Almost all sets will include this plate. 
-   **Salad Plates.** These plates are smaller than the dinner plate. Some dinnerware sets will include them to help you serve salads and other side dishes to your family without a hassle. 
-   **Bread and Butter Plates.** This is the third smallest plate in your dinnerware set, after the salad plate. They are specially designed to hold a piece of bread and a pat of butter. This plate is absent in many dinnerware sets. If you need it, you must be keen to evaluate its availability in your best dinnerware set of interests.
-   **Saucer.** This is usually the smallest plate in your dinnerware set. It is essentially designed to hold your cup or serve chocolates/cookies. 
-   **Glasses and Cups.** Some of the best dinnerware sets in the market will include several glasses of different types. They may include wine glasses, standard water glasses, small juice glasses, mugs, and teacups.
-   **Soup Bowl.** This is usually the deepest bowl in your best dinnerware set. They are designed to hold soups and prepare cereals for breakfast.
-   **Salad Bowl.** This is a small bowl (smaller than soup bowl) that you can use to serve all types of salads.
-   **Shallow Bowl.** Just like the name suggests, this bowl is relatively shallow with flat edges. It is ideal for serving curry.

### **Other Factors to Consider When Buying Your Best Dinnerware Sets** 

Besides the use, there are other factors that you should consider before you settle for your best dinnerware set. They include:

-   **The material of Construction.** How would you prefer your best dinnerware set to be like? Do you want it opaque, transparent, or translucent? All these parameters will be determined by the material used during construction. For example, porcelain is usually translucent while most glasses are transparent. 
-   **Durability.** If you’re looking for durability, you may want to consider bone china cookware. Also, vitrified glass offers a significant longevity guarantee. 
-   **Your Needs.** Like earlier indicated, your best dinnerware set must help you in fulfilling your needs and making your family happy. Ensure that your dinnerware of choice has all the components that you’d require for a satisfying experience. Some of the key components that must be there include a dinner plate, salad plate, saucer, among others. 
-   **Ease of Cleaning.** Different materials have different cleaning protocols. For example, most of the bone china cookware is not dishwasher safe! As such, you should evaluate the ease of cleaning before you settle for your best dinnerware set.
-   **Safety.** When buying your best dinnerware set, you must always check its FDA approval. If interested in plastic dishes, then you should ensure that it is BPA-free. In most cases, the manufacturer will indicate clearly whether the product meets all the requirements.
-   **Safety When Using Microwave.** Not all dinnerware sets offer the luxury of using a microwave to warm your meals. As such, you should always read through the recommendations, especially if you love using a microwave regularly. 
-   **Price.** How affordable is your best dinnerware set? While price should come last in your “factors to consider” list, you should never neglect it. If you can get all the features you need in a dinnerware set at more affordable rates, then you should go for it! However, you should never compromise the quality to save a few bucks since it will be super costly in the long run.
