## Wusthof Knives Manufacturers – A Brief Overview 

Before we delve into the Wusthof knives review, it would be best to get the manufacturer’s crucial details.

Wusthof knives are manufactured in Solingen, Germany. Wusthof knife manufacturers started their operations in 1814, making them some of the oldest knife makers globally. 

Their more than two centuries knife-making expertise enables them to make knives of unrivaled quality. It has dominated the market for many years, with a little competition from Henckels.

This article will find out how Wusthof has maintained their manufacturing excellence amid changes in technology and immense innovations.

Is it their marketing prowess, their high sense of style, or what exactly makes Wusthof knives outstanding? 

## Forged and Stamped Wusthof Knives – What’s the Difference?

Wusthof makes both forged and stamped knives. So, what’s the difference between the two? Some of the critical differences include:

-   **Manufacturing Techniques.** Forged knives are crafted using a single steel bar, which is heated and molded into a specific shape. On the contrary, a stamped knife has a sheet of steel stamped on the blade, then heated to achieve firmness. 
-   **Weight.** Since forged knives are made entirely from metal, they are heavier than the stamped knives. 
-   **Price.** Making forged knives requires more resources and time. As such, forged knives are more expensive than stamped knives.
-   **Durability.** Forged knives are more durable than stamped knives. Additionally, they maintain blade sharpness longer than the blade knives.

Wusthof is well known for manufacturing high-quality forged knives.

Their heavy knives are molded using state-of-the-art technology to ensure top-notch functionality and unrivaled ease of use. 

***Forged knives have thick blades that extend to the handle and a bolster that adds balance, thus preventing your hand from sliding towards the blade.***

## How Wusthof Knives are Made

[Wusthof](https://www.metrokitchen.com/wusthof/) uses state-of-the-art precision technology that automates most of the Wusthof knife manufacturing processes.

The use of modern technology enables the manufacturer to achieve stylish knives with super-sharp blades. 

The manufacturing process **uses [X50CrMoV15 stainless steel](https://knifeuser.com/x50crmov15-steel-review/)**. This heavy-duty material contains vanadium and molybdenum, which adds to its hardness, corrosion-resistance, and durability. Here are the steps that Wusthof use to manufacture the knives:

-   **Raw Material Processing.** This is a highly automated process that involves cutting stainless steel into rectangular bars. The material is then heated to approximately 2,200 degrees Fahrenheit. 
-   **Shaping the Knife.** Once the molten stainless steel is ready, a machine-precision technique is used to forge the bolster. Each bar is laser-cut into the shape of the blade (curved or straight). The blade is then heated to 1,950 degrees and then cooled rapidly until it gets to a 58 hardened mark on the Rockwell Scale. 
-   **Grinding the Blades.** After hardening, the knives are then heated to 350 degrees Fahrenheit before going through the grinding machine. After the process, the sharp blades are inspected and cleaned. 
-   **Branding.** Once the knives are ready, an automated branding technique facilitates the Wusthof Knives logo’s placement at a strategic location.
-   **Handle Fixing.** To complete the process, handles are attached to the knives. The company prides itself on having ergonomic handles that enable chefs to enjoy every minute in the kitchen.
-   **Quality Test.** All the knives are tested for quality before packaging and dispersal for sale.

Even after the final stage, the knives are inspected to ensure that they meet the required standards. The handles and rivets are cleaned and polished. 

Additionally, the company uses **PEtec sharpening technique** to ensure that you get the sharpest blades. 

### **What is PEtec Sharpening Technique by Wusthof?**

PEtec sharpening process uses a special whetstone, computers, and lasers to sharpen knives at optimal angles that are difficult to achieve using an ordinary knife sharpener. This sharpening technique results in sharp blades that maintain their sharpness for relatively long. 

Wusthof engineers invented the sharpening technique to enable them to achieve a thin cutting blade with superior sharpness. It follows the following simple steps:

-   Measuring the blades using laser
-   Computer calculations to ensure a pre-set sharpening angle is achieved
-   Precision robots sharpen the knives using a whetstone

Even after the robots complete the sharpening process, the knives are further polished using a special disc.

This sophisticated sharpening technique ensures that all the knives that get to the market are sharp and effective.

## Unique Features of Wusthof Knives 

Wusthof knives have become exceptionally popular due to their outstanding features. Here are a few of the features that make cooking lovers yearn to get hold of them!

**1\. Superior Quality**  

Wusthof spends time and resources to research the needs of cooks. It has invested in superb manufacturing techniques that ensure that the end product is irresistible.

The knife manufacturing process involves more than 40 steps. Each of the steps has highly skilled quality control personnel and robots to ensure that no error passes to the consumers.

**2\. High-Quality Blades**

A knife is only useful when it is sharp. If it loses this quality, it becomes hard work to implement simple recipes. Even worse, the risk of cuts is heightened by using blunt knives.

If you hate regular sharpening, then the Wusthof knives will sort you out! 

These knives have unique blades that are crafted from heavy-duty steel mixed with carbon, molybdenum, vanadium, and chromium (X50 Cr MoV 15).

> ***X50 Cr MoV 15 is not unique to Wusthof. Other German competitors such as Zwilling use the material too.***

This material is extraordinary since it ensures that you get a set of knives that can retain their sharpness for long. While the material is hard enough to maintain sharpness, it is not prone to chipping and breaking.

The balance of the materials to achieve a hardness of 58 on the Rockwell scale ensures that your knife will handle all activities without the risk of breaking. 

***Most [Japanese knife manufacturers](https://selfdefensecorp.com/how-to-use-a-pocket-knife-for-self-defense/) use materials with a hardness of 60 on the Rockwell scale, making them prone to chipping. However, any knife between 55-60 should serve you well. The lower the score, the better.*** 

**3\. Unique Designs** 

Wusthof has some of the unique knife designs you’ll ever find in the market. It offers ergonomic designs that ensure comfortability, safety, and top-notch functionality. 

If you love elegance and style, then you should not hesitate to buy the best Wusthof knife for your kitchen. 

In most of the Wusthof knives, the blade extends the handle to form a tang that prevents the hand from coming into contact with the blade.

The handles come with at most three rivets to connect the handle to the steel tang. They are contoured and have a curve at the end to allow you to get a firm grip, thus reducing any chance of an accident. 

The blades come in different shapes and forms, depending on the type of knife you choose. For example, the Chef knife has a thick blade with a sharp tip and unique curvature. 

On the other hand, the Santoku Wusthof knife has a straight edge with unique gloves that reduce friction between your veggies and the knife, thus guaranteeing top-notch functionality.

Additionally, all Wusthof knives are finished with a unique logo that depicts excellence and elegance.  

**4\. Durability** 

Wusthof knives are built to last. Like we’ve earlier discussed, the knives are crafted using a sturdy material and hardened using a unique technology to ensure that you enjoy unmatched longevity. 

Additionally, these knives come with a **POM handle** with strong rivets to ensure they remain in place for as long as the knife serves you. Even better, these knives carry a lifetime limited warranty against all manufacturing defects. 

**5\. Ergonomic Handles** 

Wusthof primarily uses a synthetic material known as POM to manufacture its handles. The material has a **unique molecular structure that ensures that it’s stiff yet comfortable**. 

It is resistant to discoloration, which guarantees that you’ll continue enjoying the glister even when the knife is exposed to high moisture and heat. 

Additionally, the POM is designed in such a way that you’ll get comfortable. They offer a highly ergonomic grip that will make chopping and dicing a breeze. 

Unlike wood materials, this material is non-porous. This feature is crucial since it prevents germs from penetrating and hiding on the handle. As such, you’ll always be sure that your knife is safe for use after cleaning. 

**6\. Safety**

While safety when using a knife is dependent mainly on your knife handling abilities, the Wusthof knives are designed with a unique design that enhances your safety. Some of the features that guarantee safety include:

-   **A Well-Designed Bolster.** This refers to the thick part of a knife between the blade and the handle. This part is crucial since it adds weight to the knife, allowing you to achieve an incredible balance when cutting your meat and veggies. Additionally, it protects your hand from sliding to the edge of the blade, which would be risky. 
-   **A Tang.** This is the part of the handle that protects the blade from detaching from the handle. In most cases, the tang is designed to offer a firm grip on the handle. 
-   **A Protruding Heel.** The heel protects your hand from sliding onto the sharp edge of the blade. It also offers comfort when holding the knife.

These are only some of the security features. Specific types of knives are designed differently to offer optimum safety depending on the task. The shape of the blades also differs to ensure that you achieve optimum performance without compromising your safety. 

**7\. Ease of Cleaning**

The Wusthof knives are easy to clean. All that you’ll need is a piece of soft cotton wool and warm water. Once you’re through with cleaning, ensure that you dry it and keep it in a safe place.

You should never clean your knife using a dishwasher. It is not only unsafe, but it also reduces your knife’s life span.

**\>A Highly Stable Knife**

Wusthof knives are well-balanced – no doubt about that. They feel heavy and solid on your hand, which eliminates the chance of sliding to unwanted areas.
