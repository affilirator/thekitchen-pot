## All-Clad Copper Core Cookware Construction 

[All-Clad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-Clad) pans are manufactured in the United State’s Pennsylvania region. The company has been in operation since 1972, mastering the art of manufacturing state-of-the-art cookware using high-quality materials. 

The use of a unique cladding construction technology (comprising several bonded metal layers) makes the cookware unique and relatively expensive. 

The All-Clad copper core cookware is made of five metal layers including two outer stainless steel layers and two inner layers of aluminum with a copper core. 

The five-ply construction has many benefits, including making the pans induction-friendly, improving heat conductivity and retention, enhancing durability, and improving the overall performance.

The outer stainless steel is highly magnetic, which makes this cookware ideal for use with induction hobs, electric cooktops, and many other different constructions. 

## Why is All-Clad Copper Core Cookware Set so Expensive?

As a beginner, shopping for cookware can be confusing. You get to encounter cookware sets that cost more than $500 and other alternatives that cost as little as $70. And you are not sure of what exactly makes the two different.

So, is an All-Clad Copper Core Cookware Set worth the high cost? Why should you buy it despite having many cheaper alternatives at your disposal? 

Well, we believe that this set is worth every coin you spend on it. That is if you love heavy and solid pans.

If you’re a fan of light pans, then you shouldn’t buy the All-Clad copper set. Its heavyweight nature will give you a headache when cleaning!

The issue of weight aside, here are several reasons why we believe that these cookware sets are worth the investment:

**The Pans are Durable** 

I know that you’re used to this statement as a marketing gimmick, right? Well, with the All-Clad copper cookware set, this statement is real! Yes, these pans are constructed using sturdy materials and unique cladding technology that protects them from warping. 

As such, you can be sure that the pans and pots will serve you for a lifetime. You’ll pass it to generations!

**Unique Construction – Hand-Crafted**

All All-Clad cookware sets are hand-crafted and checked at different stages for quality. This hands-on construction ensures that every set that comes out of All-Clad’s factory is of perfect dimensions, uniform texture, and overall top-notch quality. 

The cookware is made out of high-quality stainless steel, aluminum, and copper arranged interchangeably in cladded layers. Here’s why this construction is necessary:

![All-Clad Copper Core Cookware Set Construction ](images/portablegasgrill.jpg)

-   **Stainless Steel.** This [18/10 stainless steel layer](https://americankitchencookware.com/cookware-blog/understanding-1810-stainless-steel) is strategically placed on the inner and outer layers. It is heavier than aluminum and thus **holds heat for longer**. Additionally, the stainless steel layer is magnetic enough to allow the **use of induction hobs for cooking**. The material is also **corrosion-resistant** and easy to clean.
-   **Aluminum.** This metal is placed in the inner layers to improve heat conductivity. Compared to stainless steel, aluminum **offers better heat conductivity**. What’s even better is the fact that the **aluminum layer is light**, and thus will not add too much weight to the pans. The layer guarantees even heating. 
-   **Copper.** These pans come with a thick copper core. This layer strengthens the pans to ensure reliably responsiveness and offers **warp-free strength**. Additionally, copper is an exceptionally **good conductor of heat.** 

The unique properties of each of the layers bring in a synergy that offers exceptional performance. While the pans will be heavier due to the extra layers, the top-notch performance and durability will compensate for it. 

**Riveted Stainless Steel Handles**

The riveted handles are countered to offer an ergonomic grip. It has stainless steel lids with venting, which makes it easy for waterless and healthier cooking. 

**Compatible with All Cooktops**

The All-Clad Copper Core pans and pots are compatible with induction, electric, and gas cooktops. The versatility makes these pans ideal for everyone, thus eliminating the compatibility fear. 

However, we noticed that our All-Clad cookware set was a bit slow on our induction hob. Nevertheless, the results were great and the cooking was quiet. 

Even better, this cookware is oven or broiler-safe up to 600 degrees F. 

**Relatively Easy to Clean**

All-Clad cookware comes with a smooth surface that is easy to clean using mild detergent and a sponge. We recommend that you do not use abrasive cleaning materials.

Additionally, it would be best if you hand-wash it to retain its mirror-polish surface and maintain its elegant look for a longer time. 

### **Summary – Why All-Clad Copper Core Cookware is Expensive**

However, the pans are quite heavy. If you’d have issues with heavy pans that takes time to heat (but retains the heat well), then you should reconsider investing in this $1500+ cookware.

Overall, the cookware is worth it. Its longevity is particularly something you’ll pride in. Once you buy it, you’ll have sorted your cookware needs for a lifetime – and even for your generations.
