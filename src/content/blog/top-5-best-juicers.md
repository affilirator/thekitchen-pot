### **Best Juicers: What are Citrus Juicers?**

Citrus Juicers are the simplest, fastest, and easiest motorized juicers to use with minimal functionality of extracting juice from citrus fruits without peeling. Most of the citrus juicers are made with detachable parts that enable one to entangle and clean, then easily reassemble.

They are equipped with a pressuring mechanism extraction equipment with a vertical hand-press for assistance, which requires little effort to squeeze the juice and vegetables. More so, they have been built structurally to fit into small space, with minimal uptake

The citrus juicers can be categorically placed as cold-pressed with little or no heat generation during the juicing process on a motorized machine. This tends to prolong its shelf-life due to unscathed internal equipment.

Additionally, these juicers have a reversible mechanism to extract the stubborn ingredients in the fruit. The juice is collected within a container below which has a sieve at the top to separate the juice from the extracts. Hence, if you enjoy making your orange juice at home, this is one of the best investments.

**Best Juicer: What are Centrifugal Juicers?**

Centrifugal juicers are the fastest, affordable, and most efficient juicer used in most households. Equipped with a mesh chamber of highly spinning sharp teeth, it can be used to shred the materials and divide the ingredients and the juice.

The large feeding chute can be filled with large chunks of fruits without pre-cutting them, which enormously reduces the prep-work. Consequently, it is easy to use by just feeding fruits and vegetables into the tube that is separated at the bottom in a container, in less than a few minutes. 

However, the strenuous work and high speed subjected to the machine results in the heat, noise, and oxidation, whose outcome results in machine wearing. In consequence, the oxidation from the juicer can result in loss of nutrients, hence, leading to lower quality of juice and fridge life.

As they are known to finesse in hard, thick, and crunchy fruits, they tend to be less capable in the shredding leafy greens. The juice from Centrifugal juicers comes out a little foamy because they contain strainers and lidded pitchers, but it never tastes any different. 

**Best Juicer: What are Masticating Juicers?** 

Masticating juicers are known for their efficiency when it comes to crushing the ingredients and squeezing the extracted juice. Built with a vertical chute, the ingredients are forced into a chamber molded by pressed augers that rotate to extract the juice.

The juice is extracted through a strainer into a pitcher, where the pulp is directed to another spout. Masticating juicers are made for the extraction of any type of hardy vegetables from carrots and kale and, to softer fruits such as tangerines and berries.

Additionally, they are best suited for leafy greens juice extraction with the ability to extract even the minimal juice. Masticating juicers are also known as slow juicers because they take longer to process the fruit and vegetable extraction of the juice as compared to centrifugal juicers.

Conveniently, slow processing is beneficial in the preservation of nutrients as compared to high-performance juicers which generate heat. However, the masticating juicers require prepping time of chopping the ingredients into smaller pieces since the juicer is less efficient when exposed to strenuous work.
