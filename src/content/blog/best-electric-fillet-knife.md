## **What is a Fillet Knife**?

A fillet/filleting knife is a specialized kitchen knife used for [fish filleting](https://www.wikihow.com/Fillet-a-Fish). It has unique features that make it ideal for removing bones and skin from the fish.

Contrary to common beliefs, there is a slight difference between a fillet knife and a boning knife. While these two gadgets have functions that overlap, their anatomy is different.

For example, fillet knives are thinner and more flexible than boning knives. This feature allows you to get precise cuttings for delicate meat, such as fish. 

Additionally, boning knives have straighter blades specially designed to cut hard meat such as pork, mutton, and beef.

## **What is an Electric Fillet Knife?**

An electric fillet knife is a motorized traditional fillet knife. It has similar features to a manual or battery-operated fillet knife.

The thin blade is mounted on a motorized handle, making the filleting process more effortless and fun.

Unlike the traditional fillet knife, an electric knife will offer convenience, speed, and precision. It is the best option for professional filleting, where you're required to fillet many fishes with unmatched precision. The two main types of fillet knife are:

- **Corded Electric Fillet Knife.** This knife has a cord that supplies power to the blade. When shopping for a corded knife, you should ensure that the cord is long enough for flexibility and efficacy. 
- **Cordless Electric Fillet Knife.** Cordless knives use Li-Ion batteries. These batteries store sufficient power to undertake quite some filleting work. Fortunately, most knife batteries are rechargeable, and you'll not be required to replace them often.

To get these out of your knife, you should ensure that it is designed uniquely with filleting in mind. Don't go for just any **[general knife](https://thekitchenpot.com/best-knife-set-under-100/)** - you will be frustrated! 

### **Features of the Best Electric Fillet Knife**

**Blade's Flexibility**

This is the **most crucial consideration** you should make when purchasing a fillet knife. It would help if you chose a knife with a **thin, flexible, and durable blade**. It should also be long enough to match the length of an average fish. 

These features are the best for cutting precise fish pieces. Such a knife will ease the filleting and enable you to fillet many fishes without a hassle. 

**Material Used in Blade Construction**

The material utilized in the construction of your blade will directly affect its flexibility, durability, and versatility. 

The blades can be made from different materials, including stainless steel and chromium-enriched stainless steel. 

On this factor, we recommend that you settle for a **high-quality chromium stainless steel blade** ([9Cr steel](https://www.contalloy.com/products/grade/9cr)) since they are **flexible, corrosion-resistant, and hardy**. Even when exposed to the wet filleting environment, these knives will neither get tarnished nor rust.  

Additionally, chromium-rich stainless steel blades have exceptional edge retention, eliminating the need to sharpen them regularly. It would also help to have a mirror-polished knife for added protection and ease of cleaning. 

**Blade Shape and Length** 

Fillet knives have different shapes and lengths, all of which affect their functionality. We recommend that you buy a full tang blade (the blade runs the entire handle's length). 

Full tang knives will offer a better balance. It guarantees stability, effortless control, and strength. 

The best size of a fillet knife will depend entirely on your needs. Fillet knives come in lengths ranging from 4 inches to 10 inches. This diversity allows you to choose a blade length that matches your catch. 

Short blades are best for small fish species, such as sunfish and crappies. 6-8 inches fillet knives are best for medium-sized fish species, including trout. The knives on the upper spectrum are ideal for larger fishes, such as pike, salmon, and most saltwater species. 

If you fish regularly, we advise that you buy differently sized fillet knives. For example, you can have 4 inches, 6 inches, and 9 inches set. The set of knives you own will depend on the size of fish species you handle often. 

**Ease of Use**

Your best electric fillet knife should be flexible. The blade should flex under slight pressure, making it easy to remove the skin and cut into the soft fish meat. 

If you choose a flexible knife, you will easily follow contours when skinning, boning, and trimming fins. The ability to bend is crucial, and is determined by the thickness of the blade. 

The thicker it is, the stiffer it will be. The best knife should bend at least an inch either way when pressed on a hard surface. This way, you'll be guaranteed high-precision cuts.

**Blade's Thickness**

The thickness of the blade will determine its flexibility. The longer the blade, the thicker it is likely to be. As such, shorter knives will be thinner and more flexible than longer knives. 

The more flexible the knife is, the easier it will be to remove bones and skin from the fish. As such, you **cannot compromise on your fillet knife's ability to bend!**

Ideal fillet knives are 2.5 to 3.5 mm wide at the spine. The thinness allows the knife to maintain its sharpness and achieve the flexibility required to remove skin and work around the highly intricate rib bones. 

**Bevel Type**

Bevel refers to the surface of your knife that has been ground to form the edge. It can either be a single bevel (one-sided edge) or a double bevel (you can see an inclination angle on both sides of the knife).

The best electric fillet knife should have a longer bevel than your standard knife. It ranges from 12 to 17 degrees of inclination, which gives the knife a razor-sharp edge. This construction also ensures that you get a sharp point necessary for puncturing, with much ease. 

While this bevel angle is the best for filleting, it sacrifices durability. The thin blade will be prone to chips and breakage, especially when you accidentally hit a bone using excessive force. 

**Ergonomic Handle**

This is a critical security feature to consider when buying your best electric fillet knife. The knife is primarily used in wet environments. As such, the knife's handle should offer a firm grip to prevent slipping off the hand. 

Some of the most common materials used for the construction of handles include wood, rubber, and plastic. Whichever handle you choose, always ensure that you can hold the knife comfortably and that your hand can't slide towards the edge. One of the best shapes for your handle is an elongated teardrop shape complete with an indention near the blade's base.
