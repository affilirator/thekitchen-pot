## Buyers Guide: What to Consider When Selecting Your Best 2 Slice Toaster

Anytime you think of buying a 2 slice toaster, you will be thinking of making a long-term investment too.

As such, you must be sure of the [appliance you are buying](https://www.wikihow.com/Clean-a-Toaster). Here are the factors to consider before making the final decision.

### **1\. Warranty**

This is a must!

Purchase an appliance that gives you maximum warranty duration. After all, a 2 slice toaster is a candidate of malfunction; just like other electrical devices.

With that, ensure that you buy a toaster that is backed up with at least 2-3 years manufacturer’s warranty.

### **2\. Size**

How much free space do you have on your kitchen worktop? Or how big is the family? Well, the answer determines the size of your toaster.

If you have a small kitchen space, then consider going for a smaller model. If you have an extended family, you better go for a 2 slice toaster that has more toasting slots.

Additionally, the width and length of the 2 slice toaster slots determine what will fit inside the grooves. If you are a crunchy bread lover and you don’t want the large pieces of bread you will be toasting to get stuffed, then buy an appliance with a slot width of 1.5 inches.

### **3\. Durability**

Just imagine the feeling that arises when you buy an expensive 2 slice toaster; then, after a short time, it starts misbehaving. It sucks! Especially when the warranty expires.

As such, you should ensure you check on the quality. This will depend on the materials used to construct the 2 slice toaster. Is it stainless steel?

A properly-built 2 slice toaster will offer incredible services for longer. Some known manufactures do provide a repair service, though, so to be on the safe side, check it thoroughly before buying.

Once you bring it home, remember to keep the crumb tray clean to help in prolonging its longevity.

### **4\. Features**

Moving past the basic toasters, you’ll find that some 2 slice toasters offer features that are beyond your expectations.

Some come with LED lights that indicate a countdown for the remaining toasting time. Or they’ll alert you to make sure that you feast on your toast while still hot.

Apart from toasting, other pre-programmed features come with toasters that alter how the toaster heats the piece of bread. For instance, the bagel setting is essential in making crispier and darker pieces of bread.

You should always check if the toaster has a defroster or frozen button designed for food that comes from the freezer, consider the levers and sound alert timers. If these features are not good enough to add in your kitchen, then check on other toasters with standard features that will make your morning more interesting.

### **5\. Price**

Never be deluded to believe that only expensive 2-slice toasters will offer top-notch services! Expensive toasters may look sleeker and sharper, but they don’t necessarily make proper toast.

On the other hand, cheaper models can take a bit longer and delivers less even texture and color compared to pricier options, which comes with more heated wires and more wattage.

As such, there is need to consider the features and the functionality of any 2 slice toaster before dismissing it on account of pricing!

You’ll be shocked to realize that expensive 2 slice toasters will not always grant you 100% satisfaction. The best thing to do is taking a pause, decide on your budget, make a checklist, then do the shopping based on the features of your ideal 2 slice toaster.

But if you aren’t on a tight budget, it’s better to go for an expensive model that will serve you for an extended period. It also gives you incredible prestige!

### **6\. Ease of Cord Management**

2 slice toasters function only when connected to a power supply. That means they are linked with a cord. Very short or long cables can sound frustrating and can tangle things on the way.

Consider buying a model that comes with a retractable cord mechanism to keep things manageable and straightforward.
