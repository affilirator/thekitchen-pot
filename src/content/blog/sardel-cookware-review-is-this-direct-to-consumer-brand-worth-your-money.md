Sardel cookware is designed to offer optimum performance. Its hands-on craftsmanship coupled with an elegant finish makes these pans a desire for many professional chefs. Here are some of the features that make these pans some of the best in the cookware market. 

**5-Ply Stainless Steel Construction**

One of the most crucial considerations that you should make when choosing cookware is its efficacy. 

Traditionally, aluminum and stainless steel were the primary materials used for cookware construction. However, the pots would have challenges of heat distribution, hotspots, reactivity with food, and warping among others.

Consequently, manufacturers such as Sardel came up with multi-ply construction. This technology enables you to get the benefits of different metals without compromising the safety and efficacy of your pans. 

All Sardel skillets/pans/pots are made with 5 layers of metal:

-   Three layers of aluminum (the core)
-   An outer layer of stainless steel
-   An inner layer of stainless steel 

This construction ensures even heat distribution and durability. Additionally, stainless steel is non-reactive and will not leave any metallic aftertaste on your meals. 

**Sardel pans and pots are induction compatible and oven safe**

Sardel cookware comes with easy-to-grip handles built for comfort. Even better, its stay-cool feature guarantees safety. 

**Curved and Closed Edges** 

Sardel cookware comes with curved edges which makes pouring easy. You can be sure that you’ll experience minimal spillage when transferring liquid meals. 

Additionally, cleaning these pans is a breeze since they have a nonstick surface. All you’ll need is warm, soapy water and a sponge to restore their sparkle after every use.

Additionally, the outer layer of the pots and pans is shiny. Its elegant finish will add a sparkle to your kitchen and bring life to your cooking escapades.

**Ease of Cleaning** 

Cleaning Sardel pots and pans is blissful. It does not require harsh and abrasive cleaning agents to achieve a sparkle. 

We recommend that you use warm and soapy water. Soak the pans for 5 minutes and then use a soft sponge to wipe off the debris.

However, you should [season these pans](https://www.wikihow.com/Season-a-Stainless-Steel-Pan) regularly. It can lose its non-stick properties if you fail to season, which will result in difficult cleaning.
