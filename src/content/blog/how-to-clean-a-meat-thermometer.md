If you love BBQ, you probably use a **[meat thermometer](https://thekitchenpot.com/blog/best-meat-thermometer-for-smoking//)** to ensure that you get perfect doneness every time you grill or **[smoke meat](https://thekitchenpot.com/blog/best-offset-smoker-for-beginners//)**.

But if you don’t clean your thermometer after each use, bacteria from last week’s messy job could be making the rounds in your current meat packets.

That’s why it’s important to know how to clean a meat thermometer properly. The good news is that it takes only a few minutes and requires very few supplies. Here is how you do it like a pro.

## **Do You Need to Clean Meat Thermometer?**

Let’s face it, most of us use our meat thermometers for only a few seconds at a time. So how dirty can they get?

The truth is that every time you insert the thermometer into meat, juices and bacteria flows out onto the stem and around the sensor. Before you know it, you’ve got a mess on your hands.

Remember, the tip of a **[digital meat thermometer](https://thekitchenpot.com/blog/7-best-candy-thermometer//)** is tiny and designed to slip into tight spaces and remain there for several seconds. That’s why it needs cleaning after each use.

-   A **[plastic brush](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cleaning+brushes&crid=3BAR1FMSGCQ4T&sprefix=cleaning+brus%2Caps%2C861&?tag=kitchenpot-20)**
-   A clean, lint-free cloth (paper towels can shred and shed fibers in your thermometer).

## **How to Clean A Meat Thermometer – Step-by-Step Guide**

You should always clean your **[meat thermometer](https://thekitchenpot.com/blog/best-meat-thermometer-for-smoking//)** immediately after use. This way, you can avoid the mess of dried meat juice later.

**Step 1: Soak & Scrub**

Soak your dirty thermometer in soapy water for five minutes to loosen debris and bacteria, which will make it easier to scrub off.

(If you have a **[digital probe model](https://www.amazon.com/ThermoPro-Digital-Instant-Thermometer-Kitchen/dp/B01IHHLB3W/?tag=kitchenpot-20)**, remove it from the stem before immersing in water.)

**Step 2: Clean the Sensor**

After five minutes, use a toothbrush or plastic brush to scrub away any built-up food and meat residue. If you don’t have a brush, you can use your fingers instead.

Make sure to clean every surface carefully with soapy water, then rinse with fresh water.

**Step 3: Give the Probe a Good Rinse**

After scrubbing, give your meat thermometer another thorough rinse to remove soap residue. If necessary, you can use a cotton ball or pad soaked in alcohol to wipe down the stem and probe tip.

**Step 4: Dry Your Meat Thermometer**

Finally, dry your meat thermometer with a clean cloth or paper towel. Remember that any bacteria left on the stem can multiply rapidly if you don’t keep it dry it.

And there you have it–a sparkling-clean meat thermometer that’s safe to use for barbecuing and smoking!

## **How To Sanitize A Meat Thermometer**

In case you’re out **[camping](https://thekitchenpot.com/blog/best-camping-cookware//)**, you will likely not have enough water to be able to give your meat thermometer the thorough cleaning outlined above.

Instead, you can use a **[commercial sanitizing solution](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=sanitizing+solution+for+cleaning&crid=2Y1SVIKSYDFZH&sprefix=sanitizing+solution%2Caps%2C629&?tag=kitchenpot-20)** and follow the step-by-step instructions (for soaking and scrubbing) as given on its label.

Or you can make your sanitizing solution at home by mixing one tablespoon of bleach with one gallon of cold water.

Always rinse your meat thermometer with fresh water after sanitizing it. This will remove the bleach residue and ensure that you don’t end up eating bleach when you’re eating your barbecue!

## **How To Store A Meat Thermometer**

Every time you put away your meat thermometer, be sure to store it in a safe place where it won’t come into contact with other utensils.

Never lay your probe-type thermometer next to especially dirty items, such as sponges or soiled dishcloths. This will prevent **[cross-contamination](https://www.health.state.mn.us/people/foodsafety/clean/xcontamination.html)** and protect the probe from damage.

If you use a digital meat thermometer, make sure the stem is completely dry before storing it away in a drawer or on a hook. Otherwise, liquids can seep into the storage compartment and damage the electronics.

Don’t forget to clean your meat thermometer at least once a month, especially if you cook frequently throughout the day. This way, you can protect yourself from food poisoning and keep your guests safe, too.

## **How to Clean A Meat Thermometer – The Bottom Line**

A clean **[meat thermometer](https://thekitchenpot.com/blog/best-meat-thermometer-for-smoking//)** is a safe meat thermometer. Keep yours in good condition by following the step-by-step guide above and it will last you years of cooking enjoyment!

And, just to be sure that your **[barbecue](https://thekitchenpot.com/blog/best-infrared-grills-for-the-money//)** goes off without a hitch, and that you don’t get sick from undercooked or overcooked food, it pays to have multiple meat thermometers on hand.

This will allow you to check the progress of different kinds of food at once, while also assuring that nothing cooks for too long or not long enough.

For example, some cut-up chicken pieces may be done cooking before other larger items, such as whole chickens or briskets. Having a separate thermometer for each piece of chicken, as well as a probe-type to check the temperature of slower-cooking items, will keep everyone at your barbecue happy and healthy.
