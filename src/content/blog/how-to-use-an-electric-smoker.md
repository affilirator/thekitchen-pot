Smoking is actually one of the most ancient cooking techniques. It can be traced back to the Old Stone Age era when human beings realized that meat dried under smoke tasted better and would go for days before going bad!

As a result, smoking became a common way of flavoring, browning, and preserving meat/other meals. 

However, there have been tremendous improvements in the smoking techniques and the equipment applied in the process. One of the most remarkable improvements is the invention of electric smokers.

## **What is Smoking?** 

S[moking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking_(cooking)) is an ancient technique that was used to dry and preserve food. In the process, the users discovered that smoked food tasted better and had a unique flavor. 

Consequently, human beings adopted smoking as a cooking technique. It helps in browning, cooking, and preserving food.

## **Why is Smoking Food Necessary Today?**

It is common knowledge that smoking as a method of preservation is outdated. In the modern world, there are a myriad of technological inventions, such as refrigerators and freezers, that are used in food preservation.

As such, the sole reason for smoking today is to achieve that phenomenal taste in your food (more particularly meat). 

If you’re a meat lover, you’ll opine that smoked meat is exceptionally tasty and you can never have enough of it!

## **Types of Smoking Techniques**

There are [different smoking techniques](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoked_meat) applied when you want to achieve a smoky flavor in your meals. They include:

- **Cold Smoking** 

This is a smoking method that helps you achieve the smokey flavor without necessarily cooking the meat. 

To achieve this, you must set your electric smoker to 68 to 86 °F, thus ensuring that you have moist yet smoked meat. 

This is particularly helpful if you wish to prepare your meat away from your electric smoker. You’ll enjoy the smoke flavor regardless of your location!

Additionally, this technique is used to enhance flavor in other food items including nuts, cheese, salmon, steak, chicken breasts, and scallops. 

- **Hot Smoking** 

This technique involves smoking the meat in controlled environments, such as using your best propane smokers or gas and charcoal grill combo.

 If you do not have an electric smoker, you can always purchase a smoker box and incorporate it into your gas grills for a perfect smoking experience.

Hot smoking takes place under 126 to 176 °F for 1-24 hours depending on your needs. This temperature is ideal for cooking your meat. Consequently, you can choose to either it as it is or further saute/cook it. 

Also, you should note that smoking your meals under extremely high temperatures (of 185 °F and above) is not recommended. If the temperature is too high, the meat will shrink and dry excessively. 

- **Smoke Roasting** 

This process is what is popularly known as barbecuing or pit-roasting. It involves roasting meat while smoking it simultaneously. 

This can be achieved by using an electric smoker or any other gas grills that can achieve a temperature of more than 250 °F. Alternatively, you can choose to use a conventional oven with a smoker box placed underneath.

### **What is an Electric Smoker?**

Just like the name suggests, an electric smoker is a unique cooking appliance that relies on electrical energy for cooking and smoking your meals. It comes with electric rods that heat up to generate sufficient heat energy for your cooking escapades. 

These smokers come in two different designs, which gives you the flexibility to choose your ideal one. They include:

- **Outdoor Electric Smokers** 

These are designed especially for outdoor cooking. They are your best bet when you want to go for a camping activity or other adventurous journeys. Also, smokers are large enough to help you cook for lots of people without a hassle. 

On the downside, outdoor electric smokers are relatively heavy, which offers significant portability challenges. 

- **Indoor Electric Smokers** 

These smokers are designed for use inside your house. They are usually small and thus require less storage space. However, their small size leads to a slower cooking pace! It may take you longer to smoke and cook your meals using this technique. 

Additionally, this may offer safety challenges and require close monitoring, especially if you have children and pets in your house. As such, you should always consider the hazards associated with the indoor electric smoker before purchasing one. 

## **How Does an Electric Smoker Work?**

An [electric smoker](https://www.masterclass.com/articles/tips-for-smoking-meat-with-an-electric-smoker) is ideally useful for meat smoking. It has a cooking chamber, where you should place your meat/meal to cook. 

The cooking chamber has heating rods that are connected to your electricity source through a plug-in socket. Once you switch on the power, these rods are heated, thus providing the much-desired heat to the cooking chamber. 

Since the rods are located on the surface, the heating process occurs through convection means. This is where the heated air becomes light and ascends to the top while the cold air descends. This way, the cooking chamber will be uniformly heated within a short time. 

Additionally, you’ll have a water pan and smoker box. If you want smokey and flavorful meals, you should put the wood in the smoker box and let it smoke as the meat cooks.
