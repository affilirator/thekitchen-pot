## **What is Sous Vide Precision Cooker and How Does It Work?**

[Sous Vide Precision Cooker](https://www.wikihow.com/Cook-Sous-Vide-Steak) is a kitchen device that cooks your meals under low temperature and in [vacuum-sealed](https://thekitchenpot.com/blog/how-to-use-a-vacuum-sealer//) bags. 

The device has been in use in high-end restaurants, but it is now finding its way into home kitchens. So, how do sous vide cookers work?

Well, you will need four items to use this device:

-   A [Sous Vide](https://thekitchenpot.com/blog/best-vacuum-sealer-for-sous-vide//) Cooker
-   A Sous Vide Vacuum Sealer
-   A Sous Vide Bag
-   A Sous Vide Container

To start with, you must have your veggies/meat/any other meal vacuum sealed. Ensure that you use [food-grade vacuum sealing bags](https://www.amazon.com/FoodSaver-1-Quart-BPA-Free-Commercial-Storage/dp/B07K1W48QR?tag=kitchenpot-20) free of BPA.

Once you have your meal in the bags, you should seal it using a vacuum sealer. Ensure that no air is left in the bag (see the [**procedure of vacuum sealing here**](https://thekitchenpot.com/blog/how-to-use-a-vacuum-sealer//)).

After vacuum sealing, you should fill your sous vide container three-quarter way. Dip your sous vide machine/cooker into the water and hook it on the side of the container. Set the temperature (usually between 125 degrees F and 195 degrees F) and cook time.

Most [**sous vide cookers**](https://shrsl.com/34w7u) have a sensor that alerts you whenever the water level runs low. You link it to your mobile phone using Wi-Fi or Bluetooth and monitor your meal’s progress.
