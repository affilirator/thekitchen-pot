The debate about the safety of these pans, especially when used under high temperatures, has been rife.

And it has been a bother to many cooks and professional chefs. While **[non-stick pans](https://thekitchenpot.com/best-nonstick-pans-with-buying-guide/)** are ideal when used to cook under low temperatures, you’ll need to shift to more versatile cookware that will not limit your cooking options.

![Xtrema Cookware Review -Is It Really Non-Toxic?](https://no-waste.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/portablegasgrill.jpg)

**When using Xtrema ceramic cookware, you should ALWAYS use low to low-medium heat to lock in flavor and prevent burning. Additionally, overheating can cause a thermal crack, which will void your warranty!**

## Xtrema Cookware - Background Information and History 

![Xtrema Cookware Review](https://no-waste.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/portablegasgrill.jpg)

Xtrema’s primary goal is to manufacture cookware that **[enables you to prepare healthy meals for your family](https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=835074&u=2750617&m=52296&urllink=&afftrack=0)**. 

In 2004, the company started a line specializing in the manufacture of non-toxic cookware. To achieve this, the company chose to use pure ceramic material for all the products in this line.

Ceramic has been in use for more than 10,000 years. It was the traditional material used for preparing pots and other cookware. It has superior heat conduction and unmatched versatility. 

After searching for a reliable manufacturing partner, Xtrema settled for China. As such, all Xtrema skillets and pots are manufactured in China - a country that’s ranked highly for ceramic manufacturing, boasting almost 70% of all ceramic products globally. 

In 2007, Xtrema was registered, and the company launched its pioneer product: Xtrema® pure ceramic cookware. It has since become a leading producer of safe, non-toxic ceramic pans globally. 

## Why Xtrema Ceramic Cookware is Special 

 Xtrema has **[specialized in your safety](https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=835074&u=2750617&m=52296&urllink=&afftrack=0)**. Every cookware that comes out of the company’s factory is tested for all safety parameters and only released into the market upon meeting all the health and safety requirements.

**Unlike ceramic-coated and metal pans, [Xtrema pans](https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=832803&u=2750617&m=52296&urllink=&afftrack=0) are made of pure ceramic. They are completed with a ceramic glaze for guaranteed aesthetics.** 

Additionally, the ceramic construction guarantees even heating and high heat retention ability, enabling you to sear, saute, or fry your meals without a hassle. 

The company tests all its cookware through an FDA-regulated 24-hour heavy metal extraction test and meets the California Prop 65 standards (**you can [contact the company’s representatives](https://shrsl.com/2uzz7) to get a copy of the testing reports.**)

## Xtrema Cookware Review: Unique Features 

![Best Xtrema Ceramic Cookware for the Money](https://no-waste.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/portablegasgrill.jpg)

Besides being toxic-free, other features make Xtrema cookware stand out from its competition. They include:

**Dishwasher Safe**

Cleaning your Xtrema cookware is pretty straightforward. Its [natural ceramic nonstick surface](https://www.wikihow.com/Category:Cleaning-Cookware) is only a wipe away from regaining its smooth nature. All you’ll need is a non-abrasive cleaning agent and warm, soapy water.

Even better, you can clean your Xtrema cookware in a dishwasher. However, we strongly recommend against using a dishwasher since it can significantly reduce the longevity of your pans. 

**Oven & Microwave Safe** 

The Xtrema cookware is hardened using high heating technology. This makes them hard enough to withstand high cooking temperatures. You can also use these pans in a BBQ grill without the worry that it will release toxic elements into your food.

**Non-Scratch Surface** 

Xtrema uses a natural ceramic glaze for a smooth high-gloss surface that will not peel. The non-stick property is, by far, more effective than the one in ceramic-coated pans. 

As such, you can use **[metal spatulas](https://thekitchenpot.com/best-metal-spatula-set/)** to prepare your best meals without worrying about the possibility of a flaking/peeling surface. 

Additionally, the nonstick is natural. It has no PTFE coatings that have been associated with nonstick toxins, especially in high temperatures. As such, using these pans in extremely high temperatures is safe!

**Eco-Friendly Pans** 

Xtrema pans are tested and approved for safety. They have zero extractable - no lead, heavy metals, cadmium, PTFE, or PFOA.

**10-Year Limited Warranty**

Xtrema offer a limited 10-year warranty on all its pans. The company will replace all pans that have manufacturer defects at their cost (they will cover the shipping cost).

## **Tips on How to Use Xtrema Cookware**

To get the best results from your Xtrema cookware, you should apply the following tips:

- Allow your Xtrema cookware to **warm when using the lowest heat setting (for up to one minute)** before adding food. This eliminates the risk of the food sticking on the pan, which would result in an undesirable cooking experience.
- Use a little oil. Xtrema cookware is not nonstick. However, it will develop nonstick properties a few days into its use. As such, you should **always apply oil** if you want to get the best initial results.
- Once the cookware reaches your ideal temperature. You should reduce the heat to a lower setting. Ceramic **retains heat for longer** than other cookware materials.
- When cooking eggs (highly susceptible to sticking), you should warm your cookware on **low heat for up to 2 minutes,** then apply a few drops of oil, and turn the heat to low-medium. 

You can replace the oil with a few drops of water if you want an entirely oil-free meal. The water will prevent your meal from sticking.

Additionally, they are relatively affordable and designed using unique heating technology to ensure that they are hardy. Cleaning is also a breeze!

**In case you have stubborn debris on the pan, you can soak it in a mixture of warm water and baking soda. When the debris loosens up, you should clean the pot using non-abrasive sponges.**

Overall, these pans offer value. Investing in them will not be in vain. However, they also have a few cons that you should consider before you settle for one:

- **They Can Break.** If you fail to take care of your pots, they can break. To avoid this, we recommend that you store them away from metallic cookware and avoid applying too much pressure. Also, avoid frequent falls. 
- **The Surface can be Sticky.** If you’re frying foods such as eggs, you should ALWAYS use oil to prevent sticking.
