You can use AllTrails to track your mountain biking routes without an internet connection. This feature is available with an AllTrails+ subscription, which allows you to download maps to your phone for offline use. This means you can view detailed map information and navigate using your phone's built-in GPS while you're out on the trail, even when you don't have a data signal

To use a map offline, you need to download it to your phone while you still have an internet connection. You can do this by opening the AllTrails app, tapping on 'Saved' on the bottom navigation bar, selecting 'Lists' from the tabs at the top of the screen, and then selecting 'My maps' from the list of options. You can then tap on the download arrow in the bottom right corner of the map you wish to download

Once a map is downloaded, it will be stored in and accessible through the AllTrails app under Saved >> Downloads. You can also download your personal activities as a map, which can be useful for tracking your mountain biking routes

Remember to download the map areas before you get to the trailhead, as the app usually resets automatically after a certain amount of time with no cell service. If you donâ€™t download the map ahead of time, it will disappear from the app when you go out of cell service and you won't be able to access it

In addition to offline maps, AllTrails+ also offers other features such as the ability to print maps, get alerts for wrong turns, and share your location to see itineraries that are close to you
