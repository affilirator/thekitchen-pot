Mountain bikes with fat tires are distinguished for hunting. They are safe to ride on mud, sand, through rocks, grass and other forms of terrain that define the jungle.

The high-end bikes are fitted with a scabbard for a gun, bow or fishing pole. The bike itself is a tool for hunters since it enables them to access even those hard to reach places.

There is no better tasting thing in hunting than acquiring a hunting bike and the best mountain bike for that matter. You can do hunting while riding, scout the ditches and the brush and still keep a sharp eye on the game while cruising quickly past low lying cover.

In my former hunting years, I tried all manner of mountain bikes in the woods but Fat Tire Bikes beats them all. They are quiet, forgiving on rough terrains and very stable.

What is even more impressive about these Fat Bikes is their geometry that put you in an upright position, good and comfortable especially while riding on low speeds.

The best mountain bikes for hunting are designed in different models. We have the normal traditional mountain bikes and the more sophisticated modern electric ones. Despite the modifications that have come with time, the main feature that defines a mountain bike for hunting has remained; The Fat Tires.

I am preparing you for the best experience in hunting which I believe is the journey you are preparing for; no wonder you visited this page. Let us now look at what you need to know before purchasing a mountain bike for hunting.

## **Factors to Consider When Selecting a Mountain Bike for Hunting**

### **The distance on a charge for Electric Bikes**

You need to check how your electric bike charging system rates. Different designs come with different charge life span so you need to select one that will give you the best service. Most of the electric bikes are rated to travel about 20 miles on flat, hard ground with the power setting at its lowest, energy-saving position. If you are intending to purchase a bike where you will be travelling many miles, you can purchase an extra battery to carry with you though you should not worry much because these electric bikes can also be ridden with no power at all.

### **Handling Terrain**

Test your hunting bike on all terrains; dry, sandy, loam up the country. Try it on deep sand beds in the roads. Due to the wide, low-pressure tires, you should encounter absolutely no problem. If you purpose to ride your bike along the sides of the rocky slopes, it should not slip sideways but I would not recommend extremely sharp slopes. Choose also a bike that would cope in muddy logging roads and big hills to test the breaking system. On steep slopes, you are required to hold the brakes tight while descending. In these cases the brakes should perform flawlessly with no squeaking.

### **Bike Tire Size**

If you are a daily hunter and you want to avoid a flat tire, a dirt enthusiast who lives for single track or maybe you are an occasional cyclist looking for a comfortable ride. Depending on the kind of riding you do, you would want to choose the appropriate bike tire beyond the obvious.

Remember this is a hunting bike we are talking about so you should have the jungle in your mind as you explore your options. Check the rim size, the thread edges which of course should be sharp enough. Always replace your tires if you notice that your bike is getting a lot of flats and also when your bike is handling poorly or the threads appear rounded or uneven.

Different mountain bikes come with different tire sizes. For hunting, you should consider fat cross country tires which are meant to withstand the abuse of drops and rock gardens. Consider also those tire sizes that will exert low pressure on sandy or muddy grounds that characterizes most jungles.

### **Bike Tire Threads**

More treads typically means more grip and more toppling resistance. So you will need to balance your need for sped with your desire to grip. Knobby tires are the most appropriate when it comes to hunting. There are tires with small knobs which are faster and suitable for smooth single track. Taller knobs offer more grip in technical terrain like roots and rocks. Wide tires with sturdy paddle-like knobs are best for soft trail conditions. For the jungle you need tires designed for mud which have widely-spaced knobbies so that mud sheds from the tire.

### **Suspension**

Bicycle suspension is the system or systems used to suspend the rider and the bicycle in order to insulate them from the roughness of the terrain. Bicycle suspension can be implemented in a variety of ways or a combination of different methods.

- Front suspension.
- Rear suspension.
- Suspension seat post.
- Suspension saddle
- Suspension hub.

Bicycles with only front suspension are referred to as Hardtail and those with suspension on both the front and rear are referred to as Dual or Full suspension bikes. When a bicycle has no suspension, it is called Rigid. I know you would prefer a stiffer frame but remember that no material is infinitely stiff and therefore any frame will exhibit some flexing.

Bicycle designers intentionally makes frames in such ways that the frame itself can absorb some vibrations. Besides providing comfort to the rider, suspension system improves traction and safety by helping to keep one or both wheels in contact with the ground.

### **Throttle Mode Vs Pedal Assist Mode**

A throttle or pedal assist electric bikes: which one will you prefer? The throttle mode is similar to how motorcycles or scooters operates. When the throttle is engaged, the motor provides power and propels you and the bike forward, a throttle allows you to pedal or just kick back and enjoy your ride. The pedal-assist on the other hand is a mode that provides power only when you are pedaling. If you are used to riding traditional bike, the peddle assist mode has a more intuitive feel compared to the throttle mode. The pedal assist is also nice because you can focus purely on your pedaling and you won’t have to hold the throttle on a certain position.

Since you have to pedal, the pedal assist mode will generally give you more range when compared to the throttle mode. A lot of pedal assist bikes have different levels of assistance, for example: low, medium or high assist. It’s also good to note that some electric bikes have 4 or 5 pedal assist settings and some come equipped with both the throttle and the pedal assist modes such that you can be operating the bike in pedal assist mode and then get an additional boost by twisting the throttle. Also some have both modes but cannot be used at the same time.

Now which mode do you prefer? If you want the option to simply cruise along and pedal or not pedal, then you should consider a throttle e-bike. If you enjoy pedaling and want a more intuitive e-bike then go for the pedal assist also known as Pedelec.

More and more bikes are coming with both systems so you may have the option of using both systems depending on your style.

I hope my guide helps in making you understand what you need as you explore the different electric and traditional bikes in the market. I would recommend that you take a closer look at the following different examples for more insights. My list without an iota of doubt considers the best mountain hunting bikes that many buyers have used and recommended to be true to description.
