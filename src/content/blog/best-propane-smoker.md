## **The Best Propane Smoker: What is It?**

A [gas smoker](https://www.masterclass.com/articles/a-guide-to-propane-smokers#5-components-of-a-gas-smoker) is an outdoor cooking device that smokes food and uses propane as its heating source. Also known as vertical propane smokers, these devices incorporate wood just like charcoal counterparts. The difference between [gas smokers and charcoal smokers](https://thekitchenpot.com/best-gas-and-charcoal-grill-combo/) is the source of heat.

## 7 Best Propane Smokers

### **1. [Master Built MB20051316 Propane Smoker with Thermostat Control 40 Inch, Black](https://www.amazon.com/Masterbuilt-MB20051316-ThermoTemp-Propane-Smoker/dp/B07NQPLB1Q?tag=kitchenpot-20)**

![Best Propane Smokers ](https://no-waste.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/portablegasgrill.jpg)

Master built propane smoker makes smoking meat easy. The appliance comes with affordable price tags, ease of use, and awesome results combined to make them some of the best residential smokers in the market.

Unlike other outdoor cookers that have inaccurate, built-in heat estimators, the master built thermos temp smokers don’t have cheap built-in thermometers. The propane smokers don’t come with any thermometers at all. Instead, they use a thermostat located inside the box.

The thermostat regulates the flow of gas to the burner to maintain your selected cooking temperature. The thermostat is mounted midway at the back of the smoke box.

Compared to other vertical gassers that come with only one door to access the smoking food on top and smoking wood on the bottom, the master built propane smoker comes fitted with a separate door for food and lower door for tending wood.

**[Check Price on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Masterbuilt-MB20051316-ThermoTemp-Propane-Smoker/dp/B07NQPLB1Q?tag=kitchenpot-20)**

Although the door is not crucial, two doors let you fill up wood without disrupting cooking temperature in the upper smoke box.

The device also features an aluminized steel water pan which rests in a frame at the bottom of the smoke box. The steel water pan can also double up as a drip pan for making gravy and sauces.

Master built propane smoker features a thermotemp which has a convenient LP gas bracket that attaches the tank to the lower right side so you don’t have to schlep the tank and smoker separately.

 A fuel gauge integrated with the regulator provides a rough estimate of how much juice is in the tank. But even with this amazing feature, it’s always a good idea to have a backup tank with any gas smoker.
