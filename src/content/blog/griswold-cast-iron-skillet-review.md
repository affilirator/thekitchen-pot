It has lower sidewalls and rounded corners. 
-   **Handles.** Griswold cast iron skillets to have a sturdy but short handle. Overall, the handles are smooth and durable! They’ll not just break anyhow.
-   **Texture.** Interestingly, Griswold skillets are smoother than most **modern-day skillets**. It will ensure that you cook seamlessly without the food sticking to the pan. However, the smooth surface requires more frequent seasoning for the best results.

Griswold cast iron skillets were completed to perfection. They have fewer rough surfaces and edges, making them the best to use.

However, cast iron is generally a poor conductor of heat. As such, thicker cast iron skillets will retain heat and enhance your cooking experience.
