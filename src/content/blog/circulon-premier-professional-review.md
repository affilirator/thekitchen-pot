## Why is Circulon So Popular with Nonstick Cookware?

Circulon used resources to research and developed a nonstick material called Circulon TOTAL Nonstick (CTN). This material is exclusively for use by Circulon in the manufacture of its nonstick cookware.

So is Circulon TOTAL Nonstick the same as Teflon?

Both [CTN and Teflon](https://whatispiping.com/teflon-vs-ptfe/) have the same purpose: developing nonstick cookware that makes cooking fun and efficient. However, the two are made by different manufacturers.

Teflon manufactured their nonstick material, and they sell the technology’s license to cookware manufacturers. Since most companies don’t want to invest in research and development, they buy the Teflon license to manufacture nonstick pans and pots. This explains why Teflon is highly popular in the cookware industry. 

However, Circulon decided to pursue the research and development route. They come up with CTN, strictly used on Circulon products.

## Circulon Hi-Low Non-Stick System

Circulon is the pioneer of hard-anodized nonstick cookware. It introduced the concept more than 25 years ago, and it has continued to use its patented nonstick technology. 

Circulon uses Hi-low wave technology to boost the functionality and improve the longevity of its pans and pots. 

### **What is Hi-Low technology, and How Does It Work?**

While your food will cook on the whole surface of your cookware, there are raised circles (the Hi areas) that take the pan’s abuse. These raised areas will protect the largest parts of the pan (the Low area) from abrasion. As a result, the Circulon pans are highly durable and offer unrivaled cooking performance. 

Additionally, Circulon **hard-anodized pans have a nonstick exterior too**! This construction technique guarantees ease of cleaning, stain-resistance, and scratch/chip-resistance.

## Circulon Warranty Details

All Circulon pans and pots come with a limited lifetime warranty. It covers defects in materials and workmanship.

Additionally, this warranty offers replacement and repair services to pans that get defects under normal domestic household duties. Pans used for commercial purposes or those that get defects resulting from careless handling are not covered.

## **What Many Reviewers Will Not Tell You** 

-   **Do Not Buy** Circulon Premier Professional Cookware **if you use induction cooktops.** It will frustrate you! While the base is stainless steel, and the company indicates that it should work fine with an induction hob**, I found it VERY SLOW.**
-   While some of the Circulon pots may be indicated as “DISHWASHER SAFE,” **I found that the nonstick surface is vulnerable to peeling when you use a dishwasher.** My advice is to hand wash **(Avoid using a dishwasher!)**

## Features and Benefits of Circulon Premier Professional Cookware

Circulon premier professional cookware will offer the following benefits:

-   **Long-Lasting Non-Stick Properties.** The pots use durable patented nonstick material that’s sturdy enough for guaranteed longevity. However, we advise that you avoid using a dishwasher lest the nonstick coat starts peeling off. 
-   **Ease of Cleaning.** Circulon premier professional cookware comes with an exterior nonstick surface. This feature guarantees ease of cleaning. A simple swipe of the pan will remove all food debris. As such, you’ll not experience the hassle of removing stains.
-   **Silicone & Stainless Steel Handles.** The Circulon premier professional cookware comes with ergonomic handles that offer a comfortable grip. The handles remain cool to touch even when cooking in an oven. 
-   **Highly Efficient.** The cookware is constructed using heavy-gauge materials that guarantee quick heating and even heat distribution. **Note that these pans are not the best for induction cooktops!**
-   **Hi-Low Technology.** The Circulon premier professional cookware has high and low grooves on the surface designed specially to protect the nonstick and improve longevity. 
-   **Oven Safe.** The cookware is oven safe up to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. 
-   **Glass Lids with a Stainless Draining Feature.** Glass lids are conducive as they help you monitor your food’s progress without having to remove it. Additionally, its draining feature makes it easy for you to drain excess water without using a sieve.

## How to Clean Hard Anodized Circulon Cookware 

Cleaning your hard anodized Circulon cookware shouldn’t be a hassle. The nonstick surface ensures that you don’t burn your food, ensuring that you’ll have a sparkling pan fast. Just use warm, soapy to gently wash it. 

If you happen to burn the pan, for whatever reason, then you’ll need a different cleaning approach using white vinegar. Follow the tips below for guaranteed cleaning success:

-   Mix white vinegar and water in the ratio of 1:2. Put the mixture in the pan and place it on your stovetop.
-   Boil the mixture for 5-10 minutes 
-   Take off the pan and let the mixture settle for ten minutes.
-   Wash with warm, soapy water and rinse it thoroughly. You can use a soft material to scrub off the burnt section.

While scrubbing may be necessary to remove the burnt areas, you should always be gentle. Avoid abrasive materials since they’ll destroy your nonstick coating, thus compromising your pan’s performance.
