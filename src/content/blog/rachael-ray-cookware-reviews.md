## 6 Best Rachael Ray Cookware Reviews

### [**1\. Rachael Ray Cucina Nonstick Cookware Pots and Pans Set, 12 Piece**](https://www.amazon.com/Rachael-Ray-Porcelain-Nonstick-Cookware/dp/B00JYHNQSS?tag=kitchenpot-20)

This Rachael Ray Cucina cookware set is designed with different colors to allow you to select one that will match the theme of your kitchen. It comes in agave blue, cranberry red, lemongrass green, lavender, mushroom brown, pumpkin orange, and sea salt gray. 

It includes 1-quart and 3-quart saucepans (with lids), 3-quart saute pan (with lid), 6-quart stock pan (with lid), 10-inch & 8.5-inch frying pans, slotted turner, and a spoon. The inclusion of differently-sized frying pans and saute pan makes this one of the most versatile cookware sets in the market.

It doesn’t matter whether you have a small family or a big one, this cookware set will serve you right. However, it wouldn’t make economic sense to buy this set if you live alone. It is too large for a single individual or even a family of two.

In such a scenario, I would recommend that you buy Rachael Ray Brights Nonstick Frying Pan Set / Fry Pan Set / Skillet Set. The set comes with frying pans and a skillet, which will suffice for a small family. 

**[Check Price on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Rachael-Ray-Porcelain-Nonstick-Cookware/dp/B00JYHNQSS?tag=kitchenpot-20)**

The Rachael Ray Cucina Nonstick Cookware Pots and Pans Set, 12 Piece is made of aluminum and hard enamel porcelain exteriors, making them sturdy for any busy kitchen. The interior has a non-stick surface that offers a nonstick cooking experience.

However, the nonstick properties of these pans will not be guaranteed if you fail to season your pan. We recommend that you use a few drops of olive oil (or your preferred vegetable oil) to keep the food from sticking to the surface. 

Additionally, the cookware comes with dual-riveted and rubberized stainless steel handles that give them stay-cool features for convenience and safety. The glass lids are shatter-resistant, but can still break when they fall or get under extreme pressure. 

Also, the cookware set is PFOA-free and easy to clean. However, we found that using abrasive materials when cleaning will remove the nonstick surface. As such, you should avoid harsh cleaning agents to maintain the functionality of the pots. The pans and pots are oven safe and you can use them in an oven up to 400 degrees F. 

**The Rachael Ray Cucina Nonstick Cookware Pots and Pans Set is NOT compatible with an induction stovetop. Do not buy if you’ll solely use an induction hob.**

### **2\. [Rachael Ray Cucina Hard-Anodized Nonstick Cookware Pots and Pans Set, 12 Piece](https://www.amazon.com/Rachael-Ray-Hard-Anodized-Aluminum-Cranberry/dp/B00J9FFP98?tag=kitchenpot-20)**

![best rachael ray cookware](images/portablegasgrill.jpg)

This is a hard-anodized Rachael Ray Cucina cookware – meaning that the aluminum has been hardened with an oxide layer to make it durable and corrosion-resistant. As such, the cookware is safe and will not react with your food like other traditional aluminum cookware. 

The cookware is oven-safe and you can use it up to 400 degrees F. The interior of the pans is covered with a PFOA-free nonstick layer to enable you to get the benefits of aluminum cookware while enjoying nonstick cooking. 

The set includes 1-quart & 2-quart saucepans (with lid), 6-quart stockpot (with lid), 3-quart saute pan (with lid), 8.5-inch & 10-inch frying pans, and utensils. 

While the manufacturer indicates that these pots and pans are dishwasher safe, we recommend that you hand-wash them. If you have to use a dishwasher, ensure that you don’t include other metallic utensils since they will scratch and remove the nonstick coating, thus reducing longevity. 

The dual riveted handles offer a firm grip and are stay-cool. The glass lids are shatter-resistant and the Rachael Ray offers a lifetime limited warranty as proof of the set’s durability.

![best rachael ray cookware](images/portablegasgrill.jpg)

This is a hard-anodized version of Rachael Ray cookware that is meant for large families. It comes with 14 pieces, which are designed uniquely to offer performance and elegance. 

The winning point is the rubberized handles. These handles are highly ergonomic and offer a stay-cool experience. Besides, both the main handles and lid handles are colored to give the pan a stylish look. The glass lids are also shatter-resistant. 

The pans are made of hard-anodized aluminum to ensure that you achieve uniform heat distribution, thus eliminating the worries of hot spots. Additionally, the interior comes with a nonstick coating that ensures that you flip your pancakes/eggs without the worry of sticking to the surface. 

The Rachael Ray cookware set includes 1 Quart, 2 Quart & 3 Quart Saucepans w/ Lids, 8.5″ Frypan & 10″ Frypan, 6 Quart Stock Pot w/ Lid, 4 Quart Sauce Pot w/ Lid, 3 Quart Sauté w/ Lid. All the pots are oven safe up to 350 degrees F. When using the oven, the handles become hot and you will need an oven mitt.

![Are Rachael cookware good?](images/portablegasgrill.jpg)

This is a unique set that I’d recommend for bakers and moms. Besides the pots, the set comes with a carbon steel baking sheet, nylon prep tools, and three silicone. 

The colorful exterior and black interior make it quite stylish. If you want a cookware set with a bold sense of style, then the Rachael Ray Brights Nonstick Cookware Pots and Pans Set, 14 Piece is your real deal. 

The interior nonstick coating is durable. However, just like many other nonstick pans, it will peel off if you use abrasive cleaning agents. As such, we recommend that you hand-wash it with warm, soapy water and a sponge. 

The handles of this cookware set are double-riveted to offer extra strength and comfort, even when cooking a full pot. They are also rubberized to offer a comfortable grip and stay-cool feature throughout your cooking escapades. 

Additionally, all the pots and pans are oven safe up to 450 degrees F except the tools. The hard-enamel collection is safe and comes with a lifetime limited warranty.

It is not compatible with an induction cooktop.

If you do not want many pots, then you can consider buying this set of fry pan and skillet. The set is made of hard-anodized aluminum that guarantees even heat distribution and no hot spots. 

The interior nonstick surface is [PFOA](https://www.hungryhuy.com/what-is-pfoa/)\-free and easy to clean. However, you should not use abrasive materials when cleaning. Instead, you should soak the pan in warm, soapy water and allow it to sit for 5 minutes. After that, cleaning will be an absolute breeze. 

The exterior is also sturdy and completed with colorful porcelain to add to their longevity and style. The pans are oven safe up to 350 degrees and come with a rubberized handle to offer a comfortable grip and stay-cool feature. 

It is not induction-friendly but you can use it with any other stovetop.

These durable pans are constructed using PlatinumShield Technology. The construction ensures that you get a reinforced pan that is nine times harder than titanium and 2 times harder than stainless steel. What this means is that you will get a more functional and durable pan. 

The set includes 1.5-Quart Saucepan with Lid, 8.5-Inch Open Deep Frying Pan, 5-Quart Dutch Oven with Swing Lid, 3-Quart Saute Pan, 10.25-Inch Open Deep Frying Pan, 2-Quart Saucepan with Lid, Bench Scrape, 12-Inch Lazy.

## Racheal Ray Cookware Reviews – Buying Guide

Rachael Ray is a unique brand that offers quality cookware ranging from pans, pots, skillets, bakeware, and cookware sets.

It offers diverse construction models, primarily hard-anodized cookware, porcelain cookware, and nonstick cookware. 

When you step out to shop for a Rachael Ray cookware set, you can easily be confused by the many stylish and elegant variations available in the market. 

To save you from this hassle, we prepared this guide. Read on to know what to consider before settling for the best Rachael Ray cookware set.

### **How to Choose the Best Rachael Ray Cookware Set** 

When comparing the Rachael Ray cookware sets in the market, you should always consider functionality and aesthetics.

Most Rachael Ray cookware sets are aesthetically appealing and you may be inclined to choose based on design and colors. But these factors should come last. 

Here are some of the primary factors to consider before you settle for your best Rachael Ray cookware set:

**Functionality**

What do you want in a cookware set? Answering this question helps you to choose a set that will serve all your needs. For example, if you want a set that incorporates a bakeware tray, you should look for that specifically.

Additionally, you need to know how well the pots and pans perform with your cooktop. Most of the Rachael Ray pots and pans are made of hard-anodized aluminum and stainless steel. They may not work well with an induction cooktop.

As such, you should avoid hard-anodized and nonstick pans if you exclusively use an induction hob. 

**Construction** 

Do you want a cookware set with a nonstick coat? If no, then you should choose Rachael Ray pots and pans that do not have the coating. 

If not, then you may want to choose the traditional Rachael Ray cookware made of anodized aluminum and stainless steel. 

However, you should note that it will be more challenging to clean the traditional pots than it would be to clean nonstick pans. 

**How Many Pieces Do You Want?**

Rachael Ray has different cookware sets with different pieces of cookware. For example, you can get a 14-piece, 12-piece, and 8-piece cookware set. 

Before you settle for your ideal cookware set, ensure that you define your needs. It would be wasteful to buy a 14-piece set if you live alone. In such a case, buying a 6-piece would be an excellent idea. 

Additionally, you must check whether a set has all the pieces you need. For example, how many skillets does it have? Does it come with saute pans? Does it have a spatula? Ensure that you settle for one that serves all your needs exhaustively. 

**Features** 

The features of your ideal cookware should be present in the Rachael Ray Set you choose. For example, if you love cooking using an oven, you should ensure that you select an oven-safe cookware set, preferably up to 450 degrees F. 

Additionally, you should consider crucial features such as the nature of the handles and the lids. Are the pot lids shutter-proof? Are the handles stay cool? These factors are essential, largely because they offer convenience and safety. 

**Price**

Once you identify several sets with all your needs, you can settle for the most affordable one. However, you should never settle for a cheap one if it does not offer what you need. Cheap is not always quality. 

## Rachael Ray Cookware Sets – Are They Worth It?

Rachael Ray is, without a doubt, one of the most stylish cookware brands in the market. It comes with colorful exteriors and a highly stylish interior. 

Most of the handles are double-riveted and covered with silicone/rubber to guarantee comfort and stay-cool features

However, these pots and pans are not great for induction cookware. If you use any other type of stovetop, the cookware will serve you perfectly. 

I find these pans to be of great value. I believe investing in it will offer great convenience, functionality, style, and ease of cleaning.
