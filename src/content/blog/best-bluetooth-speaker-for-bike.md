## **Factors to Consider When Buying a Bluetooth Speaker for Your Bike**

![bicycle handlebar speakers](images/bicycle-handlebar-speakers.jpeg)

Bike speakers can be a great way to make your commute more enjoyable. There are many factors that go into choosing the right bike speaker, and we will help you find the perfect one for you!

There are 3 main types of bike speakers: in-ear headphones, helmet speakers, or handlebar mounted ones. All of these options have different pros and cons so it's important to weigh them against what is most important to you.

For example if you're looking for something small and inconspicuous then an earphone might work best but if audio quality is a priority then handlebar mounted speakers might be better suited for your needs.

Helmet mounted speakers provide good sound quality but they may not fit every head size comfortably.

A portable Bluetooth speaker is a handy accessory to have for your bike. However, picking one from the shop can sometimes be a stressful affair especially given the sheer number of options in the market. There are speakers of all shapes and sizes and of different price.

To get the best Bluetooth speaker for your bike, you need to know what you are looking for so that you can have a comprehensive checklist before you buy. I have compiled a short but comprehensive checklist of features that you should consider before buying a Bluetooth speaker for your bike.

### **Understand specifications**

It’s not ideal to base your purchase on specifications only. Though it’s a good place to start, especially if you can’t get a field test of the speaker yourself but you need to understand the use and benefits you are looking for.

### **Frequency Response**

Frequency response is measured in hertz (Hz) which is generally described as a range e.g. 100Hz-20000Hz, theoretically, the wider the range, the better the ability of the speaker to reproduce the intended sound.

However, before you judge your speaker, it’s good also to understand that different people have a different sound perception which sometimes may be caused by age or general hearing disability.

### **Bluetooth Version**

The Bluetooth version also determines the quality of audio transmission and also the distance range of your Bluetooth to the media. You should basically look for a Bluetooth 4 or even better as this one add support for Low Energy profile flor better battery life. Bluetooth 5 is the latest standard which vastly improves the data transmission rate and range.

### **Drivers**

The driver is the heart of every speaker, so it’s imperative you get a good sized driver. Most portable speakers will typically have a 40mm driver which is good size to start with. If you want a bigger driver then expect the overall size of the speaker to increase too.

The number of drivers and their placement also make a difference to how the speaker will sound. Smaller Bluetooth speakers comes with a single full-range driver positioned either facing upwards or downwards in order to display sound better. Many speakers have a twin driver set-up which tend to be louder.

### **Connectivity**

Beside wireless connectivity, it’s nice to have the option for the wired connection too. Check the Aux-in in the specification page of the speaker. It’s called the auxiliary connector, which means the speaker has a wire connection feature. A wired connection is handy if you wish to save a bit of battery on your phone or speaker and it also helps in getting better quality sound.

Many speakers also have NFC (Near-field connectivity), which helps in quick pairing with your devices. You also need a microphone in your Bluetooth speaker. It helps you answer calls directly from the speaker. This way you don’t need to look for your phone when you get a call.

### **Charging Style**

A USB charging port in your Bluetooth speaker is an added advantage, especially when you are outdoors or at a place and you don’t have a bundled cable with you. Most of the Bluetooth speakers these days have a Micro-USB port which makes it possible to charge them with power banks too.

If you have to replace batteries to listen to your favorite tunes, you need a good replaceable battery. Bluetooth speakers with rechargeable batteries often run for long durations compared to their counterparts that require charging batteries occasionally.

While it is important to look for a strong and a sturdy battery, it’s always a good idea to opt for one which also doubles as a power bank for subsequent devices as well. This is especially a goods option for individuals embarking on long outdoor trips and require to occasionally charge other devices as well.

### **Enhanced Speakers**

Most Bluetooth speakers today are capable of more than just streaming music. Other features to look for is if there is any companion app support which is crucial if you need to manage multiple speakers.

Some speakers have the support for pairing multiple speakers together for bigger sound. You may feel that one speaker is not loud enough especially when you are outdoors, which is where pairing two or more of the same type of speaker is an advantage.

### **Sturdy Construction**

A Bluetooth speaker for your bike will be used in many outdoor activities that will test limits. Therefore it’s important to look for speakers that are built to last. Look for a water resistant, dustproof and shock proof features that will protect your speaker.

### **Multiple Mounting Options**

Bluetooth speakers that come with bicycle mounts also come with other equipment ranging from carabiner clips to straps and even thread inserts that provide the user with a number of ways to carry the speakers.

You don’t have to only carry them on [bicycle mounts](https://mtbnz.com/bike-phone-mount/) but can also clip them with your belt or bag pack on your hiking trips.
