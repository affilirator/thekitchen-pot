## Ninja Foodi Cookware Set – Summary

**While these pans are marked dishwasher safe, we recommend that you [hand-wash them](https://www.cleaninginstitute.org/cleaning-tips/dishes/dishwashing-made-easy). We noticed that they discolor after using a dishwasher several times. To maintain the aesthetics, use warm, soapy water and a sponge to clean them.** 

## Ninja Foodi NeverStick Cookware Set: What’s in the Box

When you order Ninja Foodi NeverStick cookware 8-piece set, it comes with the following:

-   **8-Inch Fry Pan** 
-   **10 1/4-Inch Fry Pan** 
-   **2 1/2-Quart Saucepan with Glass Lid** 
-   **3-Quart Sauté Pan with Glass Lid** 
-   **6 1/2-Quart Stock Pot with Glass Lid**

The set offers diversity. It comes with differently-sized pans and pots to enable you to choose one that suits your needs for any given time. The small frying pan does not come with a lid. 

Additionally, the Ninja Foodi cookware set is available for bigger families. You can buy the following variations if you need more cooking capacities:

-   [Ninja Foodi NeverStick Premium Hard-Anodized 12-Piece Cookware Set](https://www.amazon.com/Ninja-C39800-NeverStick-Hard-Anodized-12-Piece/dp/B08C1FSS7D?tag=kitchenpot-20)
-   [Ninja Foodi NeverStick Premium Hard-Anodized 16-Piece Cookware Set](https://www.amazon.com/Ninja-C39900-NeverStick-Hard-Anodized-16-Piece/dp/B08C1K2XF8?tag=kitchenpot-20)

However, you should only buy the 12-piece and 16-piece if you have a big family. The pans and pots are too many for a small family, and it would be a waste. You wouldn’t want to invest in pans that will be destined to your pantry – with little or no use. 

## Unboxing Ninja Foodi NeverStick Premium Hard-Anodized 8-Piece Cookware Set

This Ninja Foodi set is heavy! As such, you should be ready to handle the weight, especially if you’re picking it a distance away from your home. 

Unboxing is also a demanding task. The packaging consists of several layers of bags and cardboards. While this was quite a chore, I found the packaging excellent, with minimal chance of transit damage. 

The first impression is great!

The pots epitomize quality and elegance. Their textured surfaces ooze with prestige. Even with the rough surface, the pans have a shiny appearance that tells you that you’re not handling any other generic set. 

But will it perform equally well?

Let’s find out how the Ninja Foodi NeverStick Premium Hard Anodized set performed in the kitchen. 

## What I Found Unique About Ninja Foodi Cookware Set 

Having used several other nonstick pans, I found Ninja Foodi unique in several elements including:

-   **Rough Nonstick Surface.** Unlike many nonstick pots, the Ninja Foodi cookware has been crafted with a relatively rough surface. While the food does not stick, it will not slide off the pan into your plate! Instead, you will need a **[spatula](https://thekitchenpot.com/blog/best-metal-spatula-set//)** to remove it from the pan. 
-   **Heats Relatively Slow on Induction Cooktop.** When compared to a stainless steel pan, the Ninja Foodi pots take relatively long to heat an equal amount of water. If you’re in a hurry, you will require one higher temperature setting to heat your water fast. 
-   **Easy to Clean.** While the surface is a bit textured, your food will not stick. You will only need a sponge to wipe off the residues. Yes, cleaning the pans is a breeze. 

While some individuals may find the rough texture off, I found it attractive. While I was unable to slide off my omelet into my plate, I easily used a silicone spatula to transfer it.

I am convinced that the textured surface contributes significantly to its durability. It is hard for **[metallic spatulas](https://thekitchenpot.com/blog/best-metal-spatula-set//)** to scratch the surface. As such, the pots can handle intense pressure without compromising their efficacy. 

**Ninja Cookware Set does not [stack](https://thekitchenpot.com/blog/7-best-stackable-pots-and-pans//) well in drawers. In matters of storage, the set scores poorly. However, they have a hole at the end of each handle to enable you to [hang them on hooks.](https://thekitchenpot.com/blog/pots-and-pans-rack-reviews//)**

## Features of Ninja Foodi Cookware Set

![Ninja Foodi Neverstick Premium Cookware Set](images/portablegasgrill.jpg)

**NeverStick Surface**

Ninja Foodi NeverStick Premium [Hard-Anodized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anodizing) 8-Piece Cookware Set lives up to its name. Its surface is nonstick and resistant to chipping & flaking. Additionally, its surface guarantees an excellent food release – you will not struggle to get off your omelet from the pan!

It comes complete with a textured surface that’s designed to offer metal-utensil safe cooking. As such, you will use your metallic spatulas without the worry of scratching the nonstick surface which would otherwise lead to the loss of the NeverStick feature. 

**To get the best nonstick results, we recommend that you preheat your pan for 3 minutes**

**Durable Construction** 

The NeverStick Ninja Foodi set has a heavy-gauge 4.5 mm aluminum base to ensure even heating. Unlike traditional nonstick pots that are created at 900 degrees F, this set is created at a maximum temperature of 30,000 degrees F for unmatched strength. 

Additionally, the pots come with tempered glass lids with a 13 mm thick stainless steel rim. This design prevents splatter and ensures that you lock in moisture for healthy meals. 

While this construction results in a highly forgiving pan, it will require longer preheating times than your ordinary pan. 

**Double-Riveted Handles** 

All Ninja Foodi Neverstick Pans come with solid stainless steel handles that are double-riveted for guaranteed strength and ergonomics. 

Even better, the handles stay cool and are long enough for maneuverability and comfort. You will not require an oven mitt when using the pots, which makes them safe when you’re sautéing, frying, steaming, braising, broiling, baking, roasting, or griddling. 

**Oven Safe** 

Ninja Foodi Non-Stick pans are oven safe up to 500 degrees F. The handles and lids are also oven-safe. 

The pans are designed to withstand high-heat cooking. You can also scrub the pans without the fear of losing the nonstick coating. Even better, the pans are PTFE, PFOA, and cadmium-free.

## Ninja Foodi Cookware Set Review – Warranty Information 

All Ninja Foodi pots and pans come with a limited lifetime warranty. However, you must use the pans as directed by the manufacturer to benefit from the warranty. 

Ensure that you avoid commercial use of the pots. Additionally, damage occasioned by careless handling is not covered by the warranty. 

## Ninja Foodi Cookware Set Review – Is it Worth It?

Ninja Foodi NeverStick Cookware lives up to its non-stick promise. The pots and pans are entirely neverstick and you’ll not struggle with cleaning. 

Additionally, the pan is heavy and durable. You’ll be guaranteed exciting cooking escapades, even when you do not want to use any oil or butter!

However, the pans may take a relatively longer pre-heating time due to their heavy construction. Also, they are not stackable and storage can be a hassle. 

Overall, the Ninja Foodi Cookware Set is worth every coin you spend on it. **[Buy it today](https://www.amazon.com/Ninja-C38000-NeverStick-Hard-Anodized-Cookware/dp/B08C1FFSBD?tag=kitchenpot-20)** and enjoy every minute of nonstick cooking!
