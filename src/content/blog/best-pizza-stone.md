## **What Is A Pizza Stone?**

Nowadays, you don’t have to use your old baking tray to bake your pizza. A pizza stone is the best way to create professional style pizzas.

The best pizza stone is a thick, flat baking stone. It comes in different shapes: round, square, or rectangular, and ranges in size from 13, 14, and 15 to 16-inches.

## **Best Pizza Stones: How do They Work?**

[Position your stone](https://www.wikihow.com/Cook-Pizza-on-a-Pizza-Stone) on the middle rack or bottom of the oven and preheat the oven.

Once the pizza is placed onto the stone, the stone’s porous material absorbs and holds the heat of the oven which is then transferred to the pizza.

The result is an awesome baked pizza with a bubbling glossy look, evenly baked in the middle and a crispy, crunchy crust that is ready for you to sink your teeth into.

## **Best Pizza Stones – Types and Materials of Construction**

Your best pizza stones can be made from different materials, some of which are not even stones. Knowing the different options, and how they compare will help you decide which stone is the best for you.

These stones are great for baking pizza because they trap and conduct heat at very high temperatures.

They radiate heat evenly, which is essential to baking a tasty pizza. The stones can last a very long time with proper care.

-   **Cordierite**
