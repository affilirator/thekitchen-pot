If you like outdoor biking with family and friends, finding the best Prius bike rack this year. I know it can be a task and particularly confusing with so many different bike carriers being available, but don’t worry, I am here to make the shopping process easier for you.

My goal is to help you narrow down options to only the best bike racks for Toyota Prius, and hopefully save you a buck or two in the process.

There are 3 Prius bike rack designs available:

- Trunk mounts

- Roof mounts and,

- Hitch mounts.

If you are looking forward to purchase the best bike rack for your Prius, you need this guide.

I have taken time to do the best selection for you in order to save you time and energy that may be needed in visiting different shops and stores looking for one.

Considering the speed of the car especially on the highway, a bike rack for Prius should be stable and should fit the vehicle properly, securely transport your bikes and fall within your budget. The wrong rack could be a safety hazard, scratch your vehicle and possibly lead to a lost, stolen or damaged bicycle.

You should also note that a bike rack even without bikes mounted, will negatively affect your vehicle’s gas economy as it leads to slowing down the speed of your vehicle leading to reduced gas mileage. With this information, you note that it’s not good to keep your bike racks always mounted when not in use.

## Factors to Consider When Buying a Bike Rack for Your Prius

![bike rack for prius](images/bike-rack-for-prius.jpg)

The key to choosing the right bike rack for your Prius is accurately defining your needs and the vehicle you have. Before buying a bike rack for your Prius, first ask yourself these questions.

- How often will you be using it?

- How many bikes do you need to transport?

- Will you need to change the racks between vehicles? i.e. change the racks from vehicle 1 to vehicle 2.

- How much are you willing to spend on your bike rack?

- How important is the security for your bike and rack?

- How high can you lift a bicycle by yourself?

- Do you have a special bike that you need transported, like a bike with an odd-shaped frame?

- Does your Prius already have a tow hitch or roof-mounted utility rack? Also look into its load capacity.

- Does your vehicle have a rear-mounted spare tire that may interfere with your bike rack?

## Types of Racks For Toyota Prius

There are three distinct categories of bike racks. The Strap-on Trunk Racks, Hitch-mount Racks, and Roof Racks. All the three types have their good and bad sides.

Also remember that not all are available for every vehicle. There are also special racks that are designed specifically for certain vehicles e.g. Pickup tracks, SUVs and now the Prius.

Some trunk racks can be used above the bed, allowing for storage underneath. Others have specialized mounts that can be attached to rear-mounted spare tires.

Let us now look closely at the strength and weaknesses of the three main types of bike racks.

### Strap-on Trunk-mounted Bike Rack

They are the least expensive option, typically going from 40$ and 200$ though some models can go up to 300$. The straps are attached to the car’s trunk hatchback or rear bumper.

The bike's frame rests on plastic-coated support arms but there are more improved carriers that have padded or indented cradles to hold the frame. These carriers must be strapped tightly to the vehicle with the frame supports and carrier arms properly oriented before mounting bikes.

They typically carry one or two bikes and in some cases three. Yes, they are not expensive and fits many vehicles, but they pose a greater chance of damaging the vehicle and the bikes than other designs.

Pros

- They are not vehicle specific; one carrier can fit many vehicles.

- Easier to lift and fit your bikes in place.

- It can easily be stored even in the vehicles trunk.

- They are quite affordable.

Cons

- The combined weight of the rack and the bikes rests on the vehicle’s body panels which can damage the vehicles paint or sheet metal.

- They may block the drivers view through the rear window.

- Straps can get loose, wear out or snap.

- Trunk-mounted spoilers can interfere with installation.

- The straps can be cut easily compromising the security of both the bikes and the rack.

- Bikes may be damaged from backing into an object or being hit by another vehicle.

- Padding may need to be added between the bikes to keep them from banging into each other and causing scratches.

- The vehicle’s trunk cannot be opened with racks installed.

- Extra attachment may be needed to support odd-framed bikes.

### Roof-mounted Bike Rack

It is the most versatile bike rack for your Prius but a bit difficult to use. Some of these racks can be attached on already existing roof rack and crossbars while others use mounting feet and clips that attach to a vehicle’s upper door frame and rain gutters. You will get a reduced price if your vehicle is already equipped with a roof rack or crossbars that will support the bike’s mount.

The basic racks start at less than 50$ per bike but the more improved models starts at around 100$, but if you need to buy the basic roof rack and crossbars, you should add about 125$ to 200$ to the total cost. When you select a roof rack, you also select the method of mounting the bikes. Some racks use a fork mount carrier that clamps onto the bike’s front wheel fork. The disadvantage is that the front wheel must be removed and stored elsewhere. However, the bike is easier to manage up on the roof and bikes with unique frame shapes can be accommodated.

The upright mounts holds the bike by the frame or pedal crank such that you don’t need to remove the front although you need to reach up higher to put the bike on, and some unusual bikes frame shapes won’t fit.

Pros

- The modular setup allows additional cargo storage with an added-on storage case.

- The rack can also be used to transport other materials like skiing and canoeing materials.

- There are lockable mounting available in the market.

- The roof racks can hold as many as four bikes or even seven depending on the vehicle.

- They can also support odd-framed bikes like the tandem and the recumbent.

Cons

- May be complicated to install.

- Vehicles can’t go into packing garages or under any overhead structure with low clearance.

- The increased wind resistance reduces gas mileage than other types making it a bit uneconomical.

- They produce more wind noise.

- Lifting a bike onto a tall vehicle can be difficult which can result to mishandling the bikes causing scratches to the car’s roof or sides.

- May not fit properly on curved-roof vehicles or convertibles.

- It touches the vehicle’s body that may lead to scratching the vehicle’s paint.

- It is not recommended to carry heavy rooftop loads due to interfering with the Centre of gravity that can compromise the vehicle’s stability leading to rollover accident.

### Hitch-mounted Bike Rack

Hitch mount racks are the most expensive but the easiest to operate. They come in different sizes to match the class of hitch on different vehicles. Class 1 hitches with 1.25 inch openings are designed for most cars. Class 3 hitches with 2-inch openings are usually found on pickups and truck-based SUVs, but your choice will depend on the number of bikes to be transported. Racks for class 1 hitches rarely carry more than three bikes and class 3 hitches though capable of carrying many bikes, they cannot be adapted to most cars. A single bike hitch can be found for under 100$ and over 125$ for popular brands and swing-away models can go for as much as 400$.

Some hitch mount racks secure bikes in mounting compartments much like the ones used with roof-mounted models. Others require you to strap the bikes securely to the carrier. With the hitch-mounted carriers, you need to keep the bikes from scratching each other.

Pros

- Very easy to install. You just slide it into the hitch.

- You don’t need to remove the front wheel to mount the bike.

- Easier to lift and secure bikes in place.

- There is reduced chances of scratching vehicles paint when mounting bikes.

Cons

- There is an added expense of the trailer hitch in case your vehicle does not have one.

- Some hitches require drilling holes into vehicle’s chassis or cutting rear fascia. This may ruin the vehicle’s appearance when the hitches are removed.

- Some small vehicles are not rated for towing, and mounting a tow hitch can affect the warranty or cause problems when the vehicle is being serviced.

- Installed rack may block access to the vehicle’s rear lift gate; the swing-away models that provide better access are a bit expensive.

- Padding may need to be added between the bikes to keep them from banging into each other and causing scratches.

- Bikes may be damaged either from banging into something or being hit from behind.

- May need extra attachments to support odd-framed bikes.

- May block the drivers view out of the rear window.

- It’s difficult to lock bikes into the rack.
