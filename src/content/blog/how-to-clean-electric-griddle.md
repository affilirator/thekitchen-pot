### **1\. Cleaning Electric Griddle Using Soapy Water and Sponge** 

-   Dish-washing liquid
-   Hot water
-   Sponge
-   Some clean clothes
-   Paper towels

**How to Clean**

-   Start by disconnecting the griddle from the power source. Safety First!

> An [electric griddle is an electric appliance.](https://content.etilize.com/User-Manual/1036203115.pdf) So unplugging it won’t cause damage to the device (or to you). From there, you can continue safely.

Also, griddles can be hot and can burn you badly when handled with less care.

-   Using a paper towel, get rid of the oily substances from the griddle’s surface. Clear the oil as much as possible by scrubbing it lightly.
-   Carefully pour some hot water on your griddle then top up some dish-washing liquid. After that, using a sponge, rub the griddle surface gently to remove the gunk and burnt food particles that got stuck.
-   With that done, dry the griddle then clean the sponge.
-   Add more hot water on the griddle again then add some dish-washing liquid. Using the sponge that you cleaned, clean the griddle surface gently. This helps in removing all leftover burnt food particles on the surface of your appliance.

Immediately you remove all the gunk, clean the griddle plate by rinsing it thoroughly to get rid of any remaining traces of dish-washing liquid. This leaves you with a shiny looking griddle that resembles a brand new appliance.

Using a paper towel or a dry cloth, wipe down the griddle then dry it out carefully before you plug it.

**Requirements**

-   Turn on the griddle then set it on low heat then watch as the grease heat up.

Also, make sure you stand some distance away from the electric griddle when using the spatula.

-   After you’ve removed excess grease, switch off the appliance.
-   With that done, disconnect the appliance from the power then allow it cool. But if the griddle has some hard grease, fill the griddle with some warm solution then allow it to stay for about 30 minutes.
-   Dip a sponge in a warm soapy solution to get rid of any traces of grease left then wipe the whole appliance using a clean cloth to clear the watermarks.
-   Soak a clean cloth in cold water then wipe over the griddle carefully. This eliminates all air marks from the machine.

Make sure you repeat the step above for 3 to 4 times. This will make your electric griddle brand new.
