## **Best Candy Thermometer- Buying Guide**

If you intend to buy the best candy thermometer, then you should check out a few features to ensure that you get optimum performance. This section offers you tips on what to consider when shopping for your best candy thermometer.

### **Different Types of Candy Thermometers**

-   **Traditional Bulb Style Thermometers**

These kinds of thermometers are pocket friendly.

However, these thermometers are susceptible to precipitation on the inside of the tube which can make them hard to read. These devices can also break easily.

Traditional bulb style thermometers also have sharp edges, crannies, and nooks. This may cause candy lucent to form and affect the full quantity of a mixture.

-   **Dial Style Thermometers** 

These types of thermometers are manually calibrated. Their thinner steel probes make it easier for the user to keep it out of the way when stirring your mixture.

With a dial style thermometer, it only gives room to mark a few key temperature points.

-   **The Steel Candy Thermometer**

The steel candy thermometer remains attached to the side of the pot throughout the entire cooking process. 

However, the steel candy thermometer can be a bit slow, and can quickly fall out of scale. So, always ensure you add enough mixture in the pot to fully cover its bulb and base.

-   **Digital Thermometers**

Digital thermometers are high-cost devices. The digital thermometers come with automatic technology for your food processing.

Additionally, the digital thermometers also come fitted with audible alarms that beep when the mixture nears its temperatures. Some digital thermometers also offer a much faster reading than manual thermometers.

### **Factors to Consider When Buying a Candy Thermometer**

-   **Thermometer Mobility**

When buying a candy thermometer, it’s always good to ensure that it can be used in more than one location. Some candy thermometers can only be fixed to the side of the pan, but may not be accurate as when the thermometer is placed in the center of the mixture

Most candy thermometers are more accurate when placed in the middle of the mixture. So when buying a candy thermometer, always ensure it can be placed on different locations of your pan.

-   **Thermometer Accuracy**

The most essential factor to consider when selecting a new candy thermometer is the accuracy of the device. Most candy thermometers are not completely accurate, but some of them come close to being accurately perfect.

Always consider a thermometer that’s calibrated within a +/-4-degree Fahrenheit range, with this you can almost be sure that the thermometer is pretty accurate. If you find a candy thermometer that does not show its accuracy range, then that might not be the best fit for you.

-   **Easy-To-Read Gauge**

Another factor you should consider when choosing the right candy thermometer is how easy the gauge is to read. Always choose a thermometer that’s easy to read even without removing it from the mixture for you to read.

Always ensure you choose a thermometer that clearly shows temperatures in both Celsius and Fahrenheit. Also, consider large designs that consist of a large evaluation gauge with clear temperature imprints.

## **Best Candy Thermometer Care Tips**

-   Always ensure you test the thermometer before use by placing it in boiling water. If the temperature is not 212 degrees Fahrenheit, then it’s not well set, so ensure you set it accordingly.
-   Clean your candy thermometer before use and after use
-   Avoid placing your candy thermometer in a dishwasher 
-   Store your thermometer in a safe place when not in use
