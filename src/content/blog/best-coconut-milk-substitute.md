## What is Coconut Milk, and How Is It Used?

Coconut milk is a milky-white liquid obtained from the grated pulp of coconut. The puree is rich in taste, oil content, and fat. 

Due to its unique taste and nutritional benefits, coconut milk is used in many recipes. It is handy when making smoothies, baked goods, tofu, meat, among many other meals. 

## How is Coconut Milk Made?

Coconut milk is extracted from mature coconuts. To get the puree, you will be required to grate the coconut’s white flesh or slice it into small pieces using your **[mandoline slicers](https://thekitchenpot.com/blog/best-mandoline-slicers//)**.

When you’re through with the grating process, you’ll **[press the grated meat to extract the coconut cream](https://thekitchenpot.com/blog/how-to-use-a-mandoline//)**. This cream is then soaked in hot water and passed through a sieve/ a cheesecloth to achieve the coconut milk. 

If you want high-quality coconut milk, you should ensure that it contains both coconut cream and milk. The cream will appear as a fatty layer sitting on top of the milky substance. 

## 12 Best Coconut Milk Substitutes

1\. **Evaporated Milk**

If you’ve been wondering whether you can use evaporated milk as a substitute for coconut milk, then worry no more!

Evaporated milk is an excellent alternative for coconut milk, especially when you’re making soups and creamy dishes. To achieve the best, you should strive to use a ratio of 1:1 in your meals.

### **How to Make Evaporated Milk**

Making evaporated milk is a straightforward process. It involves heating cow’s milk for a few minutes to remove more than 50% of its water content. The water removal makes it thick.

Heat approximately 2 ½ cups of regular cow milk until it gently boils. Ensure that you only remain with one cup of boiled milk. This process will have removed the water content in the milk to yield high-quality evaporated milk.

2\. **Greek Yogurt**

Yogurt is a healthy substitute for coconut milk. It is thick and has unmatched probiotic properties, which enhances the health of your gut.

However, you should avoid this option if you are to boil the mixture. In excessive heat, yogurt may lump and splatter, thus creating a mess.

If you want to replace one cup of coconut milk, you should mix one cup of **[Greek yogurt](https://www.amazon.com/EasiYo-Yogurt-Mix-Greek-Style/dp/B01LYK8I89?tag=kitchenpot-20)** with one tablespoon of water. This option is particularly significant when making smoothies.

**3\. Canned Tomatoes**

If you want to use coconut milk to make your curry or soup, you shouldn’t have a problem when you substitute it with canned potatoes. 

You can also mix it with cream to get the best results. For example, use one cup of passata with ¼ of cream. The mixing thickens the paste, giving a tasty curry.

**4\. Soy Milk**

Soy is one of the most effective plant-based coconut milk substitutes. It has a lower fat content, and you can use it just like you’d have used your coconut milk – including the quantities. 

Additionally, soy sauce is an excellent protein source that makes it one of the most outstanding options. One cup will provide more than 7 g of protein instead of 0.5 g that an equal amount of coconut oil would provide. 

**5\. Heavy Cream**

Heavy cream is your best choice if you want thick soups and curries. It enriches your soup with a unique taste that will leave you yearning for more.

To achieve the best results, you should use two parts of the heavy cream with 1 part of water. It is ideal for sauces, icecreams, and creamy sauces. 

**6\. Almond Milk**

**[Almond milk](https://www.amazon.com/Silk-Unsweetened-Flavored-Non-Dairy-Dairy-free/dp/B00PGXQ68Q?tag=kitchenpot-20)** is low in calories, making it the best coconut milk alternative, especially if you are dieting. 

Its unsweetened version has a relatively neutral flavor, making it an excellent option when making smoothies, eating cereals, or baking. 

Since almond milk is lower in fat content than coconut milk, you’re unlikely the creaminess that characterizes the latter. If you want to thicken it, you can add 15 ml of lemon juice to each almond milk cup. 

If you like creamy dishes, it would be best to avoid using almond milk as a substitute for coconut milk. 

**7\. Sour Cream** 

This dairy product is best when you want thick curries. It has a distinctive taste that almost equals that of Greek yogurt. 

It is rich in probiotics, which guarantees a healthy gut. However, the sour cream is relatively sweeter, and you should use it sparingly if you don’t like sweetened curries and smoothies.

**8\. Cashew Milk**

This is a milky substance obtained from cashew nuts. It works best in soup, sauces, and smoothies. It is low in calories and proteins but relatively high in fat.

You swap it with coconut oil in a ratio of 1:1 to achieve the best results. You’ll be guaranteed of smoother and creamier texture in your smoothies and sauces.

**9\. Coconut Cream**

The main difference between coconut milk and coconut cream is the thickness. The cream is more than four times thicker and has a richer taste. Additionally, coconut cream has a higher fat and calorie content than coconut milk. 

You can dilute it with water or use it without dilution. Whichever option you choose, you will get creamy smoothies and curries!

**10\. Oat Milk**

This is your ideal option if you want to make coffees and latte. It has an excellent foaming ability and only contains moderate fat. The beta-glucan fiber is responsible for foaming, and you can be sure that it will provide better peristalsis and overall gut health. 

Even better, **[oat milk](https://www.amazon.com/Califia-Farms-Unsweetened-Oatmilk-Gluten-Free/dp/B07PBFNYXV/?tag=kitchenpot-20)** is ideal when you’re cooking high-heat meals since it does not curdle. It is sweet and has more carb than coconut oil. Always substitute the coconut milk in the ratio of 1:1.

**11\. Silken Tofu**

Tofu is made by hard-pressing condensed soy milk to form blocks. It is ideal for making desserts and smoothies.

Tofu is high in proteins, and you can use it to replace coconut oil in the ratio of 1:1. If you use your **[best blender for smoothies](https://thekitchenpot.com/blog/best-blenders-for-smoothies//)**, you should get consistent and smooth soup and curry. 

**12\. Hemp Milk**

This is sweet plant milk derived from the seeds of the hemp plant (Cannabis Sativa). However, it does not contain THC, which is the addictive component of marijuana. 

It is rich in protein and fat and is ideal for baking. Additionally, it can act as a leavening agent if paired with certain fruit acids, such as lemon juice.
