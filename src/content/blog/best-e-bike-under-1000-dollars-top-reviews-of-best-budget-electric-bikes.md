## **Benefits of an Electric Bike**

This article attempts to help you know various reasons you should get an electric bicycle. In my introduction to my e-bike under 1000$ buying guide, I mentioned some of the benefits of owning an e-bike. There are more benefits of this wonderful investment as you can see below.

### **Fast and Flexible**

This is to a far extent confirmed by most of the city dwellers to be true. City traffic jams has led to a state of concern where traffic moves much slowly especially at peak hours and the police road blocks that we face so often.  In such scenarios, the benefits of electric bikes are plenty. The e-bike will get you to your destination faster than a car.

The battery powered bike speeds up to 25km/h which means that on free road, it can travel 4km in about ten minutes. If you spot a road block, you can easily maneuver it with the traffic or by pass it through other streets where even a motor cycle would not access. This is to my view the greatest advantage of an electric bike.

In the same traffic jams, where even this bike can’t pass, you can even carry it over your head through the traffic. This is a real economy means of transport.

### **Improve Fitness**

An active lifestyle is beneficial to your health. Introducing a battery operated bike into your life means that you can put aside certain times of the day for physical activity. The pedal boost gives you freedom over how much energy you want to put in. You can modulate your energy input from low intensity to medium intensity and in between while you ride.

High levels of pedal boost will take you to your destination with less effort but still get some low intensity exercise. With this bike you can engage in physical activity while still not disrupting your daily schedule.

### **Hauling Stuff**

You will be surprised as to how easy it is to carry even heavy and irregular loads on an electric bike especially the cargo one. The sturdy front basket is capable of carrying stuffs like grocery, coffee grounds and the like. There are more rooms in your e-bike that you will be surprised as to how much it’s able to transport. You can use it to navigate a heavy load through traffic with more ease and stability.

### **Health Benefits**

People who have electric bikes spend more time riding than people with regular bikes. As I did my study, I found that particularly women have mostly benefitted from the positive effects of riding bikes. They confessed to have done more trips with their e-bikes than men did.

Researchers have also shown that exercising is the best thing we can do for the health of our body. In fact most scientists call exercises a “miracle cure” for the most killer diseases like heart disease, diabetes, cancer and depression. You need an electric bike especially if you suffer from one of the above mentioned diseases. Also get one to help you keep fit and avoid diseases in your life.

### **Cut back Expenses**

Using the e-bike instead of a motor vehicle will save you money. Petrol and diesel are costly in most countries and occasionally surge, which can really affect your budget. Commuting is not cheap too but with the e-bike you can buy affordable batteries which can last you 18-50 miles after full charge depending on the riding mode you use.

### **Nature Friendly**

You can understand that the climate change and global warming have been a serious bother on earth. We need to play our part to save the earth. E-bikes have lower emissions than motorcycles and cars. Help save the earth by using an electric bike instead of a petrol or diesel car. They use energy at a lower rate of between 100 to 150watts compared to 15,000 or more for a car. As a result using an e-bike can help improve air quality.

## **Factors to Consider When Buying an E-bike**

Like any other investment, you need to consider various factors before buying an e-bike in order to ensure return for your investment. You should be keen to select the best brand that you will not only enjoy owning but also a bike that will make your everyday life, which would otherwise be tough, easier. The following are the major factors that should not escape your eye.

## **Battery**

The battery is a big factor to consider because it’s by far the most expensive component on the bike. Check the capacity and voltage of the battery depending on your needs. The minimum capacity you should consider is 24v 10Ah and 240W motor which will get you around 10miles. The higher voltage generally means the faster the bike. Note also where the battery is mounted, whether built on the frame or bolted into a rack on the back of the frame.  For the bike of this price range the battery should weigh around 10 pounds.

### **Electric Hub Motor**

Almost all electric bikes have a hub motors either at the back or front. It is a very nice commuter solution. It should be reliable, water proof, powerful enough, (power depends on motor and voltage) and interchangeable in case of failure. Check also the voltage of the motor.  At this price range 500W is very nice. Do not go for one under 250W for it will give you a very small power output and make your bike incapable of climbing uphill. In general, the larger and beefier hub motor is durable and powerful.

### **Controller**

All electric bikes need a controller to interface between the battery and the motor, but this price range does not offer controllers that have a big difference. So shift your concern to the amperage the controller puts out. Note that the higher the amperage, the higher the speed of the bike.

### **Brakes**

You need a bike with good disc brakes. This is a requirement on e-bikes capable of high speeds. They require less maintenance than caliper brakes. If you decide to upgrade your e-bike later to a more powerful hub motor, the disc brakes will be inevitable.

### **Frame**

Steel frames are best on e-bikes, enough to cater for extra pounds without compromising strength. Get a bike with steel frames or go for this type of frame in case you upgrade components later to higher power set-up. This frame can handle higher power output.

Do you need a folding bike? Don’t get a folded one unless you really need it because the frame is weaker than the traditional triangle design.

### **Wheel Size**

The e-bike does need an [efficient wheelset set-up](https://mtbnz.com/best-mountain-bike-wheels/) like a regular bike. In general, wider tires offer better and shorter wheel bases. A 20 inch one works really well on e-bike since the smaller the wheel, the better the hill climbing capacity but lower top speed.

### **Battery Monitoring**

Does your bike have a monitoring display on the handle bar? This feature helps you to know how much battery charge you have left. Usually bikes within this price range have a green to amber to red, four light LED array or other similar display if any indicator at all.

### **Warranty**

The bike you are looking for is a budget e-bike of less than 1000$. It’s important to check what kind of warranty you get with your bike. Different companies offer different types of warranty. Also note that there are other unscrupulous companies that don’t meet their promise and will charge labor fee to replace faulted parts even within the warranty period. Be sure how the company you choose handles their customers. Also check the real product before you order, some photos can be a bit misleading. I always take time to see and use the products before I recommend them in my articles. This is a guide that should give you all the details you need to ensure that you get the value of what you pay for.
