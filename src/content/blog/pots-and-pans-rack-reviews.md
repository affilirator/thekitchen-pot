**Pros and Cons of Hanging Pots and Pans Racks** 

Owning a hanging pots and pans rack can either be a good or not so good idea, depending on your needs and preferences.

## Ceiling Pot And Pan Rack

![Ceiling Pot And Pan Rack](images/portablegasgrill.jpg)

When redesigning your kitchen, you can consider installing ceiling pot and pan racks to save your cabinet/ counter space. These types of pot racks are not only highly functional but also quite classy. 

Just like the name suggests, these racks are strategically located on the ceiling. It can be above your kitchen island counter or any other location that’s ideal for you. 

However, there are several considerations you should never ignore when installing ceiling pot and pan racks. They include:

-   **Location.** We do not advise that you install the ceiling rack directly above the stovetop. While this may appear convenient, it poses a significant risk of burns and pan destruction. Remember that moisture from boiling food and direct heat from the stove will land on pans above. The pans may burn you as you try to reach them. Additionally, the moisture and too much heat may compromise the integrity of your pots and pans. T**he best location to install the racks is on the ceiling over an island or countertop**. 
-   **Height.** You should always ensure that the rack is low enough for easy access but high enough to avoid obstructions on the work counter/kitchen island. A general guideline is that the bottom of the pot rack should be 40-48 inches from the work surface. However, these measurements may vary depending on your **ceiling’s height** and **your height/ the individual using the rack**. 
-   **Installation.** When installing, you must ensure that the pot rack does not obstruct windows/other openings. Additionally, you must ensure that the chains are firmly attached to the ceiling (preferably around the ceiling’s joints). This way, you can be confident that it will be firm enough to hold the weight of all your pans. If you’re in any doubt about the installation process, you shouldn’t hesitate to consult a professional.

## How to Choose Pot and Pans Rack

Now that we’ve listed the best pots and pans rack in the market, you should be keen to ensure that you choose one that perfectly serves your needs. To achieve this, you’ll need to consider several factors before you settle for one. They include:

**Hanging Pot Rack vs Wall Mount Pot Rack vs Ceiling Pot Rack**

What type of rack do you need? Do you need one that hangs from the ceiling or one that you can mount on your wall? 

Well, answering these questions can be tricky, especially when you do not know how each one of them works. However, we’ll simplify that for you.

If you have a relatively small kitchen, you may want to consider utilizing the ceiling. This way, you will have enough space on your cabinets and counters to undertake your activities without obstructions. Additionally, ceiling pot and pan racks are quite aesthetic. They add an exquisite touch to your kitchen. 

On the other hand, a wall-mounted rack is a bit safer than the ceiling/hanging racks. There is no chance whatsoever that you’ll knock your head against pans placed on wall-mounted racks. Also, most wall-mount pots and pans rack come with a top/bottom grid, primarily made of solid surface or mesh wire. This space allows you to store heavy cookware such as cast iron skillets. 

However, the wall-mount racks have their limitations too. Some of the drawbacks that you should be aware of before buying one include:

-   They can protrude forward taking up a lot of space. It is not ideal for a tunnel-like kitchen
-   Pots can scratch your paint/wood wall surface
-   The pots can overlap, which limits their accessibility significantly. You can eliminate this by placing/arranging the pots singularly – one at a time. 

**Pot Rack with Lights vs Without Lights**

Do you need a pot rack with lights? Well, this will depend on your preference. If your kitchen is well-lit, this feature will only serve to add to your kitchen elegance. 

**[Read more on techniques that you can use to declutter your kitchen](https://thekitchenpot.com/blog/how-to-organize-pots-and-pans//)**

**Low Ceiling Pot Rack vs High Ceiling Pot Rack**

When buying a hanging/ceiling pots and pans rack, you should consider two things:

-   The height of your ceiling
-   Your height 

The primary goal should be to reach all the pans without straining. Additionally, the pans should not hang so low as to obstruct your working on the island or counter space. Always ensure that you have a minimum of 40 inches of space between the counter/working surface and the bottom of the rack.

If your ceiling is too low, you may want to consider a rack with short hanging chains to ensure that you remain with adequate working space. Vice versa is also true. 

**Material of Construction** 

Copper pot rack vs steel pot racks vs aluminum pot rack vs wood pot rack: which is one is the best for your kitchen? 

Pots and pans rack is constructed using different materials ranging from wrought iron, aluminum, copper, stainless steel, and wood. 

The choice of the material will depend on your needs. If you go for a metallic rack, we advise that you choose one with a matte finish to avoid rusting. 

Additionally, you should be keen to consider the strength of the rack you select. Some materials may be weak to support heavy cookware such as cast iron skillets and dutch ovens. 

**Shape** 

Pots and pan racks come in different shapes, including Oval, Rectangular, Square, Straight Bar, and Round.

The shape you select will depend on your preferences. However, rectangular ones with a solid top often offer more space than the straight/bar versions. 

## How to Choose Pots and Pans Rack – Wrap Up
