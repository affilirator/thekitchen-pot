## **What is an Offset Smoker**?

An [offset smoker](https://www.smokedbbqsource.com/how-to-use-an-offset-smoker/) is a simple BBQ equipment that uses charcoal or wood chips. It is also called an offset barrel smoker, horizontal smoker, or a stick burner. 

Your best offset smoker for beginners should have a large chamber where you can place your food when cooking. This chamber appears like a metal box and can come in different shapes depending on the manufacturer. 

Additionally, the horizontal smoker has a fire chamber that’s usually located next to the main chamber but a bit lower. This will be the source of your heat and its location will affect the efficacy of the equipment.

It also has an intake damper and an exhaust vent. The intake supplies the fire with adequate oxygen necessary to keep the fire burning. On the other hand, the exhaust will remove the exhaust. 

If you want to increase the intensity of the fire, you can open up the intake vent to allow in more oxygen. Closing it reduces the fire, thus enabling you to control the temperature.

## **Best Offset Smoker for Beginners – Buyer’s Guide**

Without a doubt, shopping for the best offset smoker for beginners is not easy. It can be confusing due to the wide variety of smokers available in the market.

Interestingly, you can get a smoker worth just a few bucks while another one worth several thousand dollars. So, what’s the difference between the two?

Is it the brand? Is it functionality? Or is it its efficacy? Well, this section provides comprehensive answers to all these questions. Read on.

### **How to Use an Offset Smoker (with wood chips)**

Using an offset smoker is a straightforward process. If you’re a beginner, you should follow the following simple steps to achieve a scrumptious meal with little hassle:

-   **Light Your Charcoal**

To get the best result from your smoker, we recommend that you use a combination of charcoal and wood chips. Pick your charcoal and light them. 

You can either use a gas ignition system or a chimney starter to light up the charcoal and produce sufficient heat for the best BBQ. When entirely lit, you can transfer the charcoal into your offset’s fire chamber.

-   **Place Your Wood Chips** 

While this is an optional step, we recommend that you include it if you want the best results. Pick a few pieces of wood (you may choose the flavored ones) and place them in the firebox together with the burning charcoal.

To start with, you can place the chips next to the charcoal to dry them out. After they are completely dry, you should then place them on top of the burning charcoal.

Drying the logs/chips ensure that they burn faster to produce smoke, which yields tastier BBQ while ensuring that you have an easy time throughout the process. 

-   **Wait to Achieve the Right Temperature**

When the wood chip starts burning, you need to start monitoring the temperature. We recommend that you buy the [**best meat thermometer for smoking**](https://thekitchenpot.com/blog/best-meat-thermometer-for-smoking//) for easier temperature management. The in-built thermometer can greatly mislead you!

-   **Place Your Meat on the Grates**

Once you’ve achieved the desired temperature( 225°F to 250°F), you can now reduce the opening of the fire chamber and adjust the chimney to be half-open. This helps to retain a relatively steady temperature, ideal for cooking.

Place your meat on the grates and continue [smoking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking_\(cooking\)) them until you achieve a soft and tasty BBQ. Always use your digital thermometer to monitor the meat’s temperature (including the innermost parts).

### **Offset Smoker Fire Management** 

For a beginner, [managing fire](https://www.thebarbecuelab.com/offset-smoker-fire-management/) for an offset smoker can be tricky. It requires that you be keen on how you open and close the chimney and air inlets. However, this guide will make the process relatively easier for you:

-   **Check Your Wood Chips Regularly.** You should check/ add your wood chips after every one hour. However, this will depend on the capacity of your best offset smoker for beginners. 
-   **Monitor Your Temperature.** Always ensure that you regularly check your temperature readings. If it starts going down drastically, you should consider adding wood chips. Additionally, excessively white smoke on the chimney could signal a problem in the firebox. 
-   **Check Temperature in All Corners.** In most cases, the grates will not heat uniformly. There can be a temperature difference of more than 75 degrees Fahrenheit from one corner to the next. As such, you can keep rotating the meat to achieve uniformly cooked BBQ. 

## **Factors to Consider When Buying the Best Offset Smoker for Beginners**

It doesn’t matter whether you’re an experienced shopper or not, just never ignore the following factors when shopping for the best offset smoker for beginners:

-   **Material of Construction** 

Offset smokers are constructed from different types of metals. If you want to achieve the best results, always ensure that you get one made from a heavy gauge metal. 

Ideally, the best offset smoker for beginners should be at least ¼ inches thick for guaranteed heat retention and superb results.

-   **Ease of Handling**

If you want an easy time when preparing your BBQ, you should ensure that your best offset smoker for beginners has insulated handles. This guarantees safety and eliminates the risk of injuries throughout the entire process. 

Additionally, the welds should be durable to avoid breakages. The cookware equipment should have lids that are durable and easy to open, thus easing the process of temperature management. 

Finally, you should check the accuracy of the in-built thermometer. While we don’t recommend that you rely on it, there is no harm in having an offset smoker with an accurate thermometer. 

-   **Quality of Dampers and Seals**

One of the key determinants of the success of your smoking escapades is your ability to control the temperature. To achieve this, you should ensure that your best offset smoker for beginners has top-notch seals and dampers for excellent temperature control and smoke retention. 

-   **Portability**

Do you want an offset smoker for [outdoor smoking?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbecue_grill) If yes, then you should be careful to only select one with wheels for easy movement. 

When looking at this feature, always ensure that it has sturdy hinges and latches to prevent wear and tear throughout its usage. 

-   **Availability of a Cover**

If you want a top-notch performance of your best offset smoker for beginners, you should ensure that you always keep it dry. 

To achieve this, always buy a smoker with a cover (whether as part of the package or an optional extra).

-   **Warranty**

While most offset smokers will serve you for a lifetime, it doesn’t hurt to purchase one with a warranty. This ensures that you’re covered for defects occasioned by manufacturing errors.

-   **Size**

If you’re looking for a portable offset smoker, always ensure that you get relatively small one. 

Additionally, you should consider the size of the firebox and the cooking chamber. The smaller the firebox, the more frequently you’ll be required to add wood chips, which can be draining. 

Also, small cooking chambers limit you, especially when you want to cook a lot of meat for a party! 

-   **Ease of Cleaning**

To easily clean your best offset smoker for beginners, we recommend that you buy one with removable plates. 

Additionally, ensure that it has a drain/plug to collect oil trickling from your meat. This way, you’ll save yourself from the difficulties of cleaning greasy grates. 

## **Is a Cheap Offset Smoker Worth It?**

Before you settle for a cheap offset smoker, you should always check out its potential deformities. This is not to say that all cheap smokers have defects. Just a caution that you should be careful!

Some of the common problems associated with cheap smokers include:

-   Poor seals
-   Thin material leading to low heat retention
-   Poor quality paint
-   Poor heat and smoke distribution

Considering that your best offset smoker is a lifetime investment, price should be the least of your factors to consider.
