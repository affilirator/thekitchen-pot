## **Best Immersion Blenders – Buyers Guide** 

Adding a lightweight blender to your kitchen arsenal sounds like a brilliant idea, right? Well, there is no doubt that a hand-held blender will improve your blending experiences tremendously.

The best immersion blenders will, for sure, be your ticket to healthy living! Making your creamy soups, mayonnaise, and smoothies will be a blissful exercise only if you invest in the best immersion blenders. 

While the benefits of the best immersion blenders are undisputed, getting one can be a bit hectic. It requires that you understand your needs and preferences before proceeding to purchase one.

This section will offer a comprehensive guide on what you should consider when purchasing the best immersion blenders. 

### **What to Consider When Buying Your Best Immersion Blenders**

Buying the best immersion blenders require a thorough consideration of these factors. They will help you to decide whether the investment will be worth your money. These factors include:

-   **Power**

How many watts of power do you need to complete your blending tasks? There are several power options you can consider ranging from as low as 200 watts to as high as 800 watts.

If you need to blend hard items, you will need a blender with high power. However, an immersion blender with 200 watts will perform light assignments such as making soups from beans. 

The higher the wattage, the better the immersion blender will be. As such, you should always consider wattage before settling for the best immersion blenders.

-   **Speed**

If you love blending and juicing, you understand that making different types of juices/smoothies require different blending speeds, right? Well, this means that the ability to control the speed of your best immersion blenders is critical. 

As such, you should always be careful to check the speed limits (how fast or slow can you best immersion blender’s blades rotate?). 

When preparing delicate things like mayonnaise, sauce emulsification, or even whisking, you’ll need slow speeds. On the other hand, blending relatively tough ingredients requires quicker rotations. 

-   **Ease of Operations**

You should always check the settings of your handheld blender. Is it a push-button blender? Is it a manual setting blender? Or will you require any previous expertise to operate it?

Answering all these questions with honesty will enable you to choose the best immersion blender without a miss. Additionally, you should check on the ability to change the speed while it’s still in operation. 

-   **How Much Noise Is It Making?**

First off, you should understand that it’s not possible to get an entirely quiet immersion blender since the noise originates from the rotations of the blenders.

However, some models have modifications that significantly reduce the noise levels without affecting its efficacy. 

The more power you need, the more rotations per minute (RPM) you’ll require, and the more noise you’ll get. Always check the noise levels before purchasing (usually labeled in Decibels). 

If it is labeled as O Decibels (0 dB), it means that the manufacturer has undertaken superb modifications that keep the noise to the inside of the blender. 

-   **How Much are You Willing to Spend?**

With a budget of $20-$50, you should be able to get a good blender. The difference in pricing is largely due to factors such as noise levels, the power (watts), ergonomic features, among many others.

While pricing is a necessary consideration, you should never compromise on the quality of your best immersion blender. You should be especially careful with the Wattage, RPMs/Noise Levels, and ease of cleaning. You’d rather pay a few extra bucks and get the exact features you need depending on your kitchen needs!

-   **Ease of Cleaning**

How will you clean your immersion blender? Do you want to use a dishwasher? Well, you should note that not all immersion blenders are dishwasher safe. Consequently, you should be keen to only select that which will give you easy cleaning time. 

Nevertheless, cleaning a handheld blender should never be a problem. Just rinse it with warm soapy water immediately after use! 

The only challenge would be a blender with too many curves and cracks. In such cases, you’ll be forced to use cotton wool to access the regions, which can be hectic and time-consuming. 

-   **Warranty Availability**

Electronics are prone to dysfunctions. In some instances, the problems can be linked to manufacturer errors. As such, you should ensure that you only purchase an immersion blender with a guaranteed warranty.

This way, you can rest assured that any malfunction will be addressed by the manufacturer, thus saving you repair costs. 

Ensure that you understand warranty coverage and duration before purchase. 

-   **Durability**

When purchasing the best immersion blenders, you should check the material of construction. Is it metal or plastic? Metal tends to be more durable than plastic, but plastic is friendlier in ease of handling. As such, the blender you choose will largely be based on personal preferences. 

If you’re using your blender more often, you should consider going for a metallic immersion blender. Ensure that your blades, handles, shaft, body, and motor are strong enough to handle your large workload.  

-   **Power Cord Length** 

There is nothing as annoying as having a power cord too short that it limits your ability to make your purees and smoothies! As such, you should measure the length between your source of power and your cooking counter. 

Ensure that your best immersion blender’s cord is long enough to guarantee convenience when cooking. 

## **Best Immersion Blenders – What are the Accessories/ Attachments that Come with It?**

Best immersion blenders come as a complete package to enable you to perform many blending-associated functionalities with incredible ease. All the blenders come with a main blade head (either plastic or metal-based) necessary for the main blending challenges. 

Additionally, some of the best immersion blenders also come with jugs, beakers (of up to 500 ml), and bowls. Some of the blenders may have beakers with lips and lids for ease of pouring and safety when storing your food. 

Some of the attachments that will come with your best immersion blenders include:

-   **Star Blade Head.** If you want to shred meat, you should consider using this blade. It works better than the main blade.
-   **Whisk Head.** This accessory comes in handy when you are baking. It helps you to whisk and mix creams and other ingredients when cooking. It achieves unmatched uniformity, thus guaranteeing better outcomes. 
-   **Masher.** If you want to mash potatoes, pumpkins, or any other food substance, then you should replace the main blade with the masher. 
-   **Frothing Blade.** This is necessary when preparing froth milk and mixing batters when making your cakes. 
-   Mini-Chopper. This stand can accommodate your handheld blender (fit your immersion blender into it) to help you process nuts and herbs. 
-   **Food Processor Unit.** The best immersion blenders may come with a larger stand where you can fit your immersion blender and prepare hard portions of foods. You can slice vegetables, grate cheese, and mix pesto/hummus. 

Other unique accessories that may come with the best immersion blenders include Pan Guard, Splash Guard, Lids, and Storage Cases. 

All these accessories are critical since they improve the efficacy of your blenders. They simplify operations and ease your storage needs. 

### **The Best Immersion Blenders: Why Accessories/ Attachments are Necessary**

Like we’d previously stated, even the best immersion blenders may have functionality limitations when compared to countertop blenders and other food processors. 

Due to these limitations, manufacturers have found a way to make the best immersion blenders all-inclusive. One of the best innovations to solve the challenges is by incorporating side accessories.

These add-on items that will improve the functionality of your immersion blender. For example, an ordinary immersion blender will not easily cut herbs and ice! 

However, with a food processor accessory, you’ll be able to slice meat, cut herbs, and perform many other functions without a hassle.

That said, having your best immersion blender will be akin to having a food processor, a mixer, and a countertop blender; all as one package!

## **What are the Downsides of Immersion Blenders?**

By now, you’re likely beaming with optimism believing that the best immersion blenders are all-round kitchen appliances that’ll solve all your blending problems. However, this might not be the case!

Just like any other appliance, the best immersion blenders are limited in their functionality. As such, there are several functions that they cannot perform entirely while others can but sparingly. 

In this section, we let you know several downsides of the best immersion blenders to allow you to make a well-informed purchasing decision. 

### **Disadvantages of Hand-Held Blenders**

-   **Significantly Less Power**

This shouldn’t come as a surprise. These small immersion blenders do not have the same muscle as big countertop blenders and food processors. 

As such, an immersion blender will not serve you right if you intend to regularly blend hard items. For example, crushing nuts into a smooth paste or crushing ice may be beyond the abilities of the best immersion blenders.

However, simple tasks such as making bean puree and preparing thick soups will be a breeze when using the best immersion blenders. 

-   **Can Easily Overheat**

The best immersion blenders are made especially for light tasks. As such, using them continuously for long may lead to impaired functionality. 

-   **Minimal Stability**

Unlike countertop blenders, the best immersion blenders are handheld, which can affect stability. However, most manufacturers have found creative ways of circumventing the problem by integrating ergonomic handles.

As such, you should always consider the ease of handling before settling for your best immersion blender. 

## How to Clean and Maintain Your Best Immersion Blender

The best immersion blenders are highly versatile and will surely revolutionize your cooking escapades. They enable you to make different soups, purees, and other healthy meals without breaking a sweat.

However, these benefits will be short-lived if you fail to clean, maintain, and care for your best immersion blenders. 

Even worse, a dirty immersion blender will not only impair its functionality but also pose a significant health issue. The food remains and the curbs will provide a fertile breeding site for microorganisms if not cleaned immediately after use! 

Here is a step-wise guide on how to clean your best immersion blenders:

-   After blending, you should dip it into a glass with warm and soapy water (ensure that the glass is only half full to avoid spillage.
-   While still dipped in the soapy water, run it for about 20 seconds
-   Pour the water and refill the glass with warm water (no soap). Dip the immersion blender and run it for another 20 seconds. 
-   Once through, you should switch off your source of power and unplug the immersion blender.
-   Using a clean kitchen towel, wipe out the water until dry! 

You should always clean the immersion blender immediately after use. This way, you can be sure that you’ll not have to deal with the headache of food sticking on the blades and motor.

However, it’s normal to feel lethargic and unwilling to clean it immediately. In that case, you should just take your meal first and come back to clean it later (this requires soaking or using a dishwasher).

Always be keen to check whether your best immersion blender and its attachments are dishwasher safe. If not, then you’ll have no option but to soak in warm, soapy water and clean it as described above. 

> **You should never submerge the blender’s body underwater. Only let the motor and the blades into the water.** 

In cases where you want to use hard-to-reach areas, you can dip a cotton swab in soapy water and use it to wipe your blender clean. 

## Best Immersion Blenders Storage Tips

When storing your best immersion blenders, you should always ensure that all its parts are clean and dry. This way, you’ll have eliminated the risk of rust and mildew, which would otherwise be health hazards.
