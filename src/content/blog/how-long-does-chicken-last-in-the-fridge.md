## **How Long Can Raw Chicken Last in the Fridge**

Raw chicken will become contaminated easier than the cooked one. It is more prone to bacterial colonization which will consequently result in it going bad faster. 

As such, we recommend that you cook your chicken before storing it in your refrigerator. This will increase the duration of your food to remain fresh in the refrigerator. 

According to the [US Food and Drug Administration](https://www.fda.gov/home), a **raw chicken will stay fresh in the fridge for 1-2 days.** 

Even worse, raw chicken can easily produce juices that will contaminate other food substances in the refrigerator. As such, we recommend that you only use leak-proof containers if you want to store raw chicken. 

## **How Long Can Cooked Chicken Last in the Fridge** 

Cooked chicken will have a relatively long shelf life in a refrigerator than raw chicken. Unlike the raw chicken, **cooked chicken can stay fresh for 3-4 days**.

However, you must ensure that you first store your chicken in an air-tight container. This will eliminate air, thus minimizing the chances of bacterial growth. Consequently, a chicken in an airtight container will last longer than a cooked chicken stored in an open/poorly sealed can.

## **How to Vacuum Seal Raw Chicken Before Storing in the Refrigerator**

If you’re wondering how long a vacuum-sealed chicken lasts in the fridge, then this section will answer all your questions. 

As earlier indicated, the primary goal of refrigerating your chicken is to prevent the growth of undesirable microbes that lead to contamination. 

To achieve this, you must ensure the following:

- Low temperatures
- Limited air supply

At 35 degrees Fahrenheit, it’s difficult for microbes to thrive. It even becomes harder if you deny them any trace of oxygen. 

To achieve this, we recommend that you use a vacuum sealer to store your chicken in an air-free environment. The sealers use a suction technique to suck the air out of the storage bag before sealing it. 

As such, your chicken will be stored in a vacuum, which will increase the time that they can remain fresh in a fridge. 

Use the following simple steps to vacuum seal your chicken:

- Fill your vacuum bag with your chicken
- Fasten the bar sealer and turn on your vacuum sealer machine
- Remove (it’s now sealed) it and store
