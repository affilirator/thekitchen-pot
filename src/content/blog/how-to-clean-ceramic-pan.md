## The History of Ceramic Cookware 

Interestingly, ceramic pans are among the [earlies](https://www.xtrema.com/blogs/blog/history-of-ceramic)[t](https://www.xtrema.com/blogs/blog/history-of-ceramic) cooking appliances. The human race started making them thousands of years ago to aid them in cooking. 

The initial cookware sets were made from a mixture of animal fat, bone ash, and smooth clay-like material. 

In some parts of the world, such as Asia, the use of ceramic cookware has remained the favorite method of cooking traditional meals. 

However, the inventions of technologically advanced cooking pans masked the use of ceramic until recently when manufacturers started producing modern ceramic pots, skillets, and griddles. 

Due to their enhanced functionality, the ceramic cookware items have been accepted in the current world. Top manufacturers, including T-Fall, Calphalon, Rachael Ray, and [Paula Deen](https://thekitchenpot.com/blog/paula-deen-cookware-reviews//), are making unique ceramic cookware.

## Ceramic Cookware vs Ceramic-Coated Cookware – What is the Difference?

Ceramic cookware is made out of 100% pure ceramic material while the ceramic-coated ones are made of a different material but coated with ceramic.

Even then, the ceramic coat is not clay but a non-stick material made of silicon and other inorganic substances. 

While these materials are largely oven safe (up to 842 Fahrenheit), you should avoid using them under high temperature since they have the potential to emit poisonous fumes and other toxins.

## Is Ceramic Better than Teflon?

![Ceramic Cookware vs Teflon Cookware](images/portablegasgrill.jpg)

100% ceramic cookware is better than Teflon. However, ceramic-coated cookware may compare competently with the Teflon cookware.

As such, Teflon cookware is not ideal if you’re cooking using extremely high temperatures in an oven. 

On the other hand, the ceramic coating is made of silicon and inorganic elements which makes it safe from PFOA and other chemicals. Additionally, ceramic is a better heat conductor that helps you achieve uniform heat distribution with ease.

While it boils down to personal preference, the ceramic cookware is better than Teflon-coated cookware. However, this will vary depending on preferences, needs, and budget.
