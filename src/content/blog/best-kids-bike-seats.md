A child bike seat is one of those clever inventions that allow us to enjoy riding a bicycle with our child. They are normally mounted on the front or behind a cyclist’s seat and not on the side like trailers.

In both cases, however, the child will always be facing towards the front. The average age for putting your child in such a seat ranges from 1-5 years old.

Having a child bike seat at the front is always a given plus. One of the biggest benefits is that the child is surrounded by your protective arms and should they need any attending to, it does not take much for them to capture your attention.

The child will also have an interactive experience, having the same joy that you get from cruising through different sceneries and terrains. You also get the added bonus of having your back clear for carrying any other gear you may need for you and your child.

## What Makes for the Best Baby Bike Seat?

![rear child bike seat](images/rear-child-bike-seat.jpg)

Here are a couple of important things to consider when you are toying with the idea of buying a child bike seat.

### Security

You will want to make sure that the child bike seat you are thinking of purchasing is safe for both you and your child. Make sure that the seat does not make it difficult to balance your bicycle and in case of a fall, your child is as protected as possible. A good scrutinizing of the security harness for the child is very important. If it looks like your child can fly off when you suddenly halt the bicycle then it is not the right child bike seat for you.

### Comfort

Riding your bicycle with your child does not mean that the ride has to be uncomfortable. Make sure it leaves you space to pedal well and safely reach the handlebars. The child bike seat can also be fitted with padded foam to make sure your child is not wincing with discomfort on every little pebble you tread on.

### Easy to remove and attach

The child bike seat should not be so hard to remove that you have to leave your child on the bicycle once you get to the grocery store or if you want to do some riding alone. The process should be as quick and hassle-free as possible. Too many wrenches and screws will only discourage you from taking the baby out on a lovely joy ride.

Last but not the least, make sure that the child bike seat can fit on as many types of bicycles, if not all.

## What is a Baby Bike Seat?

This is a special saddle that is designed to hold the child safely on a bike. The seat is mounted on the bike’s rear or front section. Most of the seats will come with straps to secure the toddler, therefore, you will not have to worry about your kid falling from the bike.

## What is the best age for a kid to use a bike seat?

Kids can use the bike as long as they can sit up without any support. The best age is usually between one year and 4 years since the kid can sit unsupported. Ensure that your kid has a helmet on whenever your ride together.

## Which are the best child bike seats?

We embarked on a 2 months study with a goal of comparing and reviewing a variety of child bike seats in the market. During the study, we interviewed parents who love cycling, experts and manufacturers. Besides, we also tried out some of the toddler’s bike seats to get first-hand experience of using the product.

## Front mounted child bike seats vs rear mounted kid’s bike seats

There are two types of toddler’s bike seats, the first type is the front kid’s bike seat while the second one is the rear kid’s bike seat. I prefer carrying my kid using the front mounted bike seat since they offer a cool bonding experience with my 2 year old daughter. The only shortcoming about them is that they have a weight limit of 35 pounds. Once your kid exceeds this weight, you’ll have to invest in the rear mounted bike seats.

For the rear child bike seat, it is attached to the bike via the seat post, rack, or the frame. If your bicycle does not have a rack, ensure you buy one that has a high weight limit on Amazon. Additionally, you can convert your ride to a long-tail cargo bike and you will be good to go. Most of these bike seats will fit kids up to 70+ pounds.
