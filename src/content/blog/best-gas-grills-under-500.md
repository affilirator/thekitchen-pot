## **Best Gas Grills Under 500 – Your Buying Guide**

When it comes to grilling, you don’t have to break the bank to get a great gas grill. There are plenty of options on the market for under $500 that offer exceptional performance and features.

In this section, we’ll look at everything you need to know about the best gas grills under $500. Whether you’re an experienced griller or a novice, these tips will help you find the right model for your needs.

**[Read on how to use an electric smoker in 5 simple steps](https://thekitchenpot.com/blog/how-to-use-masterbuilt-electric-smoker//)**

### **What is a Gas Grill?**

Before we jump into our buying guide, let’s start by defining what a gas grill is. A gas grill is a cooking device that uses either natural gas or propane to create an open flame for **[grilling](https://thekitchenpot.com/blog/best-infrared-grills-for-the-money//)** food.

It is different from charcoal grills, which use charcoal briquettes to generate heat. Gas grills are more popular than charcoal grills because they require less effort and produce less smoke.

However, some manufacturers offer **[gas and charcoal grills combo](https://thekitchenpot.com/blog/best-gas-and-charcoal-grill-combo//)** models that offer the best of both worlds. This way, you can switch between gas and charcoal depending on your grilling needs.

### **What to Look for in a Gas Grill Under 500?**

When shopping for a gas grill under $500, it’s crucial to consider several factors. Some of the most important ones include size, BTUs (British Thermal Units), cooking surface area, material quality, features, and ease of use.

**Size**

The size of the gas grill you choose should depend on how much grilling space you need. Smaller models are great for tailgates, picnics, and camping trips. On the other hand, larger units are more suited for family cookouts or large gatherings.

When selecting a gas grill, look for one with enough room to cook all your food without crowding the grates. Generally speaking, you’ll want at least 300 square inches of cooking surface area.

**BTUs**

This refers to the amount of heat produced by the **[gas grill](https://thekitchenpot.com/blog/best-propane-smoker//)**. A higher BTU rating means more heat, which can be helpful if you need to cook food quickly. Look for a gas grill with at least 10,000 BTUs or more.

The total BTUs depend on the number of burners and their settings. For example, a gas grill with two 10,000 BTU burners will have 20,000 total BTUs. These are measured per hour, so the higher the BTU rating, the hotter and faster your food will cook.

**Cooking Surface Area**

The cooking surface area of a gas grill is measured in square inches. This refers to the space available on the grates for cooking food. If you plan on hosting large gatherings or have many people to feed, you’ll want a gas grill with more cooking surface area.

Additionally, we recommend you get a gas grill with foldable side shelves. This will give you more workspace when prepping food, ensuring everything is cooked to perfection. If it has hooks for utensils, then even better!

**Material Quality**

The material used for a gas grill’s construction plays a critical role in its performance and lifespan. Most models use stainless steel, porcelain-coated steel, or cast iron.

Stainless steel is the most durable and can stand up to the elements, while porcelain-coated steel is better for preventing rust. Cast iron grates are great for retaining heat, but they need more time to heat up.

On a personal level, I find cast iron to be the best choice as it holds heat better, and your food will cook more evenly. It is the best for searing and it’s the favorite of many experts.

**Features & Ease of Use**

Look for gas grills with features like temperature gauges, built-in lights, and grease collection systems. These make grilling easier and help you cook food more evenly. Additionally, look for models that are easy to assemble and clean.

If you like the convenience of gas grills, you’ll love how easy they are to use. You don’t need charcoal or lighter fluid; just turn it on, set the temperature dials, and start cooking.

However, not all have automatic igniters, so ensure you check for this feature if you don’t want to use a match or lighter. This will ease the entire process of grilling, making it quicker and more efficient.

**Portability/ Flexibility**

Finally, if you plan on taking your gas grill with you on the go, look for one that is lightweight and has folding legs. This will make it easier to transport and store when not in use.

If you want even more flexibility, manufacturers offer gas and charcoal grills combo models that offer the best of both worlds. This is great if you want to switch between gas and charcoal grilling depending on your needs. You can also use **[smoker boxes](https://thekitchenpot.com/blog/best-smoker-box-for-gas-grills//)** to add a smoky flavor to your meals.

## Tested & Proven Tips for Choosing the Best Gas Grills Under 500

When selecting the best gas grills for under 500 dollars, look for a large cooking surface area, ample BTUs & heat output, good material quality, ease of use, and portability. Also, consider whether you want to add charcoal grilling to your arsenal with a combo model. Other considerations include:

-   **Warranty.** This is important to protect your investment in case something goes wrong. Most manufacturers will offer a warranty of one year on parts and labor.
-   **Ignition System.** Look for gas grills with an automated ignition system so you don’t have to use matches or lighters.
-   **Fuel Type & Consumption.** Most **[gas grills use propane](https://thekitchenpot.com/blog/best-propane-smoker//)**, but some may offer natural gas. Ensure you check how much fuel it consumes, as this will impact your recurring costs.
-   **Price.** When buying a gas grill, you don’t need to break the bank to get a good one. There are plenty of quality grills under 500 dollars to last you many years if properly maintained and cared for.

## Conclusion -Best Gas Grills for the Money

At this point, you should have a better understanding of what to look for when choosing the best **[gas grills under 500 dollars](https://www.amazon.com/Cuisinart-CGG-7400-Four-Burner-Heavy-Duty-Barbecue/dp/B091FM5P39?tag=kitchenpot-20)**.

While you might find grills with lower price tags, it’s important to remember that you get what you pay for. Investing in a good gas grill will save you money in the long run and ensure that your outdoor cooking experiences are enjoyable and hassle-free.
