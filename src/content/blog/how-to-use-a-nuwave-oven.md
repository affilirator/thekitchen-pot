I love cooking and, like any other chef, I am always on the lookout for [appliances that can make the exercise fun](https://thekitchenpot.com/blog/coolest-kitchen-appliances-to-buy//). 

Recently, I discovered a pretty efficient kitchen appliance – a Nuwave Oven. This appliance has undoubtedly revolutionized my cooking. It is easier and faster to cook any type of meal than when using my conventional oven. 

In this article, I have compiled my experiences with the appliance alongside a comprehensive guide on how to use a nuwave oven efficiently.

## **What is a Nuwave Oven?**

With busy life schedules, homeowners are always looking for novelties that can help them make their meals in record time without compromising the quality. 

Manufacturers have taken advantage of technology to invent unique kitchen appliances that use advanced techniques to cook food in a healthier and faster way. 

One such appliance is Nuwave. While you may feel like manufacturers exaggerate their adverts, I assure you that this appliance delivers exactly what the manufacturer promises. 

The appliance combines convection, conduction, and infrared systems to ensure that you get a healthier, juicier, and faster way of cooking. Read on to understand how to use a nuwave oven to get all these benefits. 

## **How Does a Nuwave Oven Work**

Nuwave Oven is possibly one of the most advanced cooking appliances you’ll ever get. I surely believe that it is a perfect enhancement of [air fryers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_fryer).

[**Read a comprehensive NuWave Oven vs Air Fryer’s comparison here**](https://thekitchenpot.com/blog/nuwave-oven-vs-air-fryers//)

The appliance uses infrared, conduction, and conventional cooking technology simultaneously to make your cooking process a breeze. 

This is how each of the technique work:

-   **Infrared.** This refers to wavelength emitted by heated bodies. Nuwave has developed and patented a unique Infrared technology that makes sure that your food browns nicely while cooking comprehensively on the inside. This is one of the features that make Nuwave Oven stand out from other conventional ovens. 
-   **Convention.** Most home ovens use conventional cooking techniques where hot air circulates to heat and cook food. When heated, the air becomes light and rises to the top of the oven. This movement occurs until your meals cook entirely. 
-   **Conduction.** This technique is useful in transferring heat from a hot material to any other good conductor material that comes into contact with it. This technique is useful when cooking using gas stoves and fry pans. Nuwave Ovens have a grill/dish that helps in heat transfer.

Since Nuwave Oven combines these three techniques, it guarantees quick and efficient cooking. When I compare it with a conventional oven, I am getting more browned and uniformly cooked meals.

I find this appliance important when cooking turkey or any other form of meat. Interestingly, you can cook your frozen meat without having to defrost it. 

## **Is it Healthy to Use Nuwave Oven to Cook?**

Nuwave Oven is one of the safest and healthiest cooking options in the market today. It does not involve the use of any harmful gas or other hazardous materials. 

Additionally, the manufacturer designed this appliance to allow oils and other fats to settle at the bottom of your oven. This way, you’ll have less oil in your food, making it healthy and delicious. 

### **Is Using Infrared for Cooking Healthy**

Since the development of infrared cooking and the release of Nuwave Oven in the market, there have been questions on the safety of infrared when used in cooking appliances. 

Consequently, multiple research studies have been conducted to determine the efficacy and possible health hazards of using this cooking approach.

In [one of the studies](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/24/22/4125/htm), researchers endeavored to determine the effect of infrared on physicochemical properties and nutritional value of various foods. The findings showed that infrared, when used at the right dosage, is an environmentally friendly method of cooking.

As such, you should never fear using your Nuwave Infrared Oven. It will offer one of the safest and quickest methods to cook your meals!

This appliance has pretty straightforward usage. The nuwave oven temperature settings are easy to access and set. This way, you’ll be sure that you can use the easy-to-navigate control panel to set your ideal temperature – based on the meal you want to cook.

-   **Plugin Your Appliance.** After covering the oven, you should plugin and switch on the power source. If you’re using a digital nuwave oven, the control panel will light up to allow you to adjust the cooking settings.
-   **Press on the Cook Time Button.** The oven is set to start at approximately 350F unless you program it otherwise. Additionally, you’ll be required to select the cooking time (in hours/minutes).
-   **Start Cooking.** Once you’re through with all the settings, you should press the START button to start cooking your meals. When the set time is exhausted, the appliance will stop cooking and beep to alert you that the cooking process is complete.
