Being a baker can be quite an interesting career and hobby. As a professional baker, I can confidently say that baking bread is a fascinating task.

From the weighing of the ingredients to kneading so you can form the gluten network to form the good structure of the dough, everything is just captivating. 

However, no matter how strictly you follow the instructions in [bread making](https://www.tasteofhome.com/recipes/basic-homemade-bread/) and even ensure you knead your dough carefully, you still can’t achieve a loaf of bread with good volume without proofing.

And yes! This is where you require the best bread proofing basket. And maybe you’re wondering what is bread proofing? It is simply rising of the bread dough through a process called fermentation where the yeast can react with the sugars and salts to rise your dough.

With all this information, even if you’re an amateur in baking you now have a clue what the best bread proofing basket is.

Well, your best bread proofing basket will give the dough a good shape and texture that will enhance its overall appearance.

Before buying a bread proofing basket you need to consider so many factors, like the shape and size of the basket and the material that best fits your requirements.

This article will carefully guide you on the best bread proofing basket to choose from when buying one.

## **What is Bread Proofing?**

[Proofing of bread](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proofing_\(baking_technique\)) refers to a process where yeast converts sugar to carbon dioxide and alcohol in the absence of oxygen, causing the dough to rise.

## **Best Bread Proofing Baskets – Types of Banneton Baskets**

There are various types of bannetons. I prefer cane baskets but there are other options to choose from.

-   **Wood pulp bannetons**– these types of bannetons are mostly made in Germany from 100% local spruce trees and you will rarely stick to the basket
-   **Cane wicker bannetons**– wicker makes a suitable container as it allows the air to circulate the dough helping it to rise well. Cane baskets are durable and they also give your bread a beautiful pattern.
-   **Lined bannetons**– linen-lined proofing baskets are also a great selection when choosing a proofing basket.
-   **Plastic bannetons**– plastic bannetons are not the best as they are not durable and they also don’t give a beautiful shape.
