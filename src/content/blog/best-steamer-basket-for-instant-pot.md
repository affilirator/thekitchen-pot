## Best Steamer Basket for Instant Pot – Factors to Consider When Buying

Before you settle for the best steamer basket for [instant pot](https://thekitchenpot.com/blog/instant-pot-vs-pressure-cooker//), you should consider the following crucial factors:

**Size**

What is the size of your instant pot? Your best steamer basket for instant pot should fit perfectly for enhanced efficacy. 

Never buy a steamer basket for instant pot if it does not indicate its size based on quart capacity. For example, if you buy a steamer basket meant for 5-quart while your instant pot is only 3-quart, you can be sure that you’ll have problems!

Always remember that the best steamer basket for instant pot should be designed in a way that it’ll elevate your food above the water level. This encourages steaming which yields into uniformly cooked meals!

**Best Steamer Basket for Instant Pot – Check Ease of Cleaning!**

Your best steamer basket for instant pot should be easy to clean. If you can get the mesh baskets, you can be certain of versatility, but food can be trapped in the mesh leading to difficult cleaning. However, these steamer baskets are affordable and spacious.

On the other hand, a punched-hole steamer basket is easier to clean but has less food-holding space. 

As such, you should weigh the benefits of each type and decide what you want. If ease of cleaning is on top of your list, then you can consider the punched-hole type. 

**Durability**

Your best steamer basket for instant pot should be made out of sturdy materials for guaranteed longevity. If you want prolonged service, ensure that it is made from a material that cannot rust easily.

Additionally, ensure that the screw/rivets used can withstand the highly moist environment for long. 

**Type of Basket You Want**

When selecting your best steamer basket for instant pot, you should ensure that it serves your needs optimally. There are several types including:

-   **Stacked Steamer Baskets.** These have two or more steaming areas stacked on each other. Consequently, the steam will cook the food as it flows upwards through the stacked baskets. 
-   **Sectional Steamers.** These come with rigid inserts that split your instant pot into 2-4 chambers. This allows you to cook different foods concurrently.

Whichever type you choose, ensure that it’ll serve your needs the best!

**Construction Materials**

Most steamer baskets for instant pot use stainless steel or silicone. The stainless steel ones are known for rigidity and longevity.

On the contrary, the silicone baskets are light, easy to handle, and versatile. Whichever steamer basket you choose, you should always ensure that you consider longevity as a primary consideration!

**Parts of the Steamer Basket**

Some of the parts that you should consider include:

-   **Handle for ease of lifting.** If you get one with a silicone-coated handle, it would be ideal since it’ll be easy to lift it even when hot.
-   **Lid.** While this is not mandatory, it may help to maintain a constant temperature, thus increasing the cooking speed.
-   **Stand.** This helps to keep your basket away from water. One without a good stand will not cook your food evenly!

## Best Steamer Basket for Instant Pot – Bottom Line

Buying the best steamer basket for instant pot will undoubtedly improve your cooking experience when using an [instant pot](https://www.delish.com/food/a51371/things-you-should-know-before-using-an-instant-pot/).
