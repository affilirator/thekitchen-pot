## Best Cookware for Induction Cooktop – Definitions

You’re probably wondering what the fuss about induction cooking is all about, right? Well, this is a cooking method that is gaining popularity fast!

In this section, we’ll detail everything that’ll help you understand how induction cooking works.

### **What is Induction Cooking?**

If you love cooking, you understand that there are many types of pots ranging from non-stick, ceramic, and stainless steel types.

But did you know that it’s possible to use some of these pans without thermal heat?

Well, unlike the regular stovetops that release flames to heat the pots through thermal conduction, the induction cooktops do not generate thermal heat!

Instead, they use electric current to directly heat your pot. The electric current is generated through magnetic induction.

But how does that happen?

An induction burner has a coiled wire which helps in generating oscillating magnetic fields. When the electrons move around, they create an electric current that heats the pot!

This cooking method is highly efficient. It has been found to boil water 50% faster than the regular gas or electric cookers.
