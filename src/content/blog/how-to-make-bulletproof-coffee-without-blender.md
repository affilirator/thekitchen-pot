## **What is Bulletproof Coffee? The Story Behind Bulletproof Coffee**

Bulletproof coffee is a [high-calorie beverage](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/bulletproof-coffee-benefits) that was developed and promoted by Dave Asprey, an American entrepreneur. 

He developed the bulletproof coffee while hiking in Tibet where he tasted yak-butter tea. On returning to the US, he tried making buttered drinks.

After several trials, this diet author published the initial bulletproof recipe on his blog in 2009. He recommended the drink for people who want to lose weight without compromising on their nutritional needs. 

Since then, the drink has become popular in the United States. It remains one of the most sought-after beverages, especially by individuals who are determined to lose weight. However, the drink is ideal for anyone.

## **Why is it Called Bulletproof Coffee?** 

Well, Bulletproof is a brand name. The name was adopted by Dave Asprey immediately after publishing the coffee recipe. 

Additionally, he patented the name and registered Bulletproof 360, inc and Bulletproof Nutrition Inc. in 2013 and 2014 respectively.

When asked why he chose the name Bulletproof, Asprey indicated that the name was a gift from one of his neighbors on a Virgin Atlantic flight from London. 

## **What are the Ingredients for Bulletproof Coffee?** 

Bulletproof coffee is made from the following ingredients:

Interestingly, bulletproof beverage uses a unique form of coffee. The low-mold coffee is arguably mycotoxin-free, thus making it healthier than your ordinary coffee. 

## What is Low-Mold Coffee as Used in Bulletproof Beverage?

## Is Bulletproof Bad for My Health?

Having a cup of your favorite bulletproof coffee is fine. However, it is necessary to consider some of its downsides when used as a breakfast substitute. They include:

-   **It is Low In Nutrients**

Bulletproof coffee provides lots of fats, which makes you full and reduces your appetite (the reason why it is recommended for weight loss).

Grass-fed butter only contains vitamins A, K2, and conjugated linoleic acid. On the other hand, the MCT oil is highly refined and lacks essential nutrients.

As such, replacing your meals with bulletproof coffee will surely deny you some essential nutrients, necessary for optimum body functioning. 

-   **Has High Saturated Fats**

When taken in large amounts, saturated fats can result in health problems. However, the right amounts are essential for the body.

As such, you should always strive to strike a balance. To achieve this, we recommend that you only take bulletproof coffee occasionally. 

-   **May Raise Your Cholesterol Level**

Ketogenic diets are high in fats. Bulletproof coffee falls in this category (this is particularly occasioned by the butter).

## Can Bulletproof Coffee Help in Weight Loss?

Yes, bulletproof coffee is one the surest technique to help you healthily lose weight. Its ingredients are designed to reduce food intake while keeping you full. 

However, bulletproof coffee cannot work in isolation. You must continue to live a healthy life and exercise regularly to achieve optimum benefits.
