When shopping for the best magnetic knife strip, we recommend that you buy one that has hidden neodymium magnets. The strong hidden magnets are protected from the external factors that may lead to the loss of their magnetism power. 

Additionally, you should always remember that cheap is not always quality. While we acknowledge that there are high-quality and affordable magnetic knife strips, we recommend that you ensure that it uses strong magnets.

## How to Choose the Right Magnetic knife Strip for Your Kitchen Needs 

When choosing the best magnetic knife strip, you should consider several factors. Your primary goal should always be to get a knife holder with strong magnetic properties and one that can hold heavy knives without a hassle.

The shape, material, and appearance of the magnetic knife strip will undoubtedly influence your decision. We highlight what you need to know before you settle for your ideal magnetic knife holder/strip. 

**[Read on how to choose the best pots and pans rack for your kitchen](https://thekitchenpot.com/blog/pots-and-pans-rack-reviews//)**

## Other Crucial Factors to Consider When Buying a Magnetic Knife Strip

**Size**

The number of knives that you own will determine the size of your magnetic knife strip. The size ranges from as low as 10 inches to as high as 24 inches. 

If you choose a wall-mount magnetic strip, you should ensure that your designated installation area is enough for your choice strip. For example, it would be a waste if you bought a magnetic strip of 24 inches whereas you only have an empty installation space of 20 inches. Remember that cutting the bar will affect its magnetism and reduce its efficacy and durability significantly. 

As such, you should always measure the area of installation before selecting your ideal magnetic knife strip.

If space is not a problem for you, then we’d recommend that you buy a 24-inch. Cutlery will always increase and you’ll find yourself adding more knives to your kitchen. That way, you will always have a space to store them. Largely, the size you choose will depend on your preferences and space availability. 

**Material**

Do you want aesthetically appealing magnetic knife strips? If yes, then you want to consider wooden strips as they are stylish and elegant.

However, you should be careful not to be carried away by aesthetics to compromise functionality. Aesthetics should always be secondary!

Alternatively, you may consider the stainless steel magnetic holders. These are naturally metallic and lack aesthetic appeal. Additionally, there is a higher possibility of your knives getting scratches than when using the wooden ones. 

**Design/ Appearance** 

The design of your ideal magnetic knife strip is largely dependent on your preferences. Some homeowners would love a strip that matches their cupboards and the overall theme of their kitchens. In such cases, they would pick a nicely finished wooden magnetic strip. 

Additionally, some of the strips come with double bars. The two bars may give a firmer grip but it all depends on the width of each. For example, one bar that’s wide enough will work equally well as the two thin bars. 

**Ease of Installation**

Installing the magnetic knife strips may include lots of grilling holes on the wall, which can be a hassle for many people. If you find this draining, you may want to consider a no-drill magnetic knife strip or one that allows the use of double-sided tapes. 

Before you settle for the best magnetic knife strip, ensure that it has all the installation hardware and clear installation guidelines. If you find the process hectic, you may want to engage a professional to install the strip on your behalf. 

**The Power of the Magnet Used**

This is, without a doubt, the most important consideration to make when shopping for the best magnetic knife strip in the market. The power of the magnet determines how well the knives attach to the strip. 

If you get one with weak magnets, you can be sure that the knives will slip away once in a while, which is extremely dangerous. 

As such, you should always ensure that your ideal magnetic knife strip comes with powerful Neodymium magnets. Unlike standard magnets, the Neodymium ones are durable, stronger, and offer a stronger grip.
