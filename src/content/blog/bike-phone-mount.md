## **Things to Consider when Buying an MTB Phone Mount**

For you to choose an apt **bicycle phone mount** that will serve your needs to your fulfillment there are certain factors you need to put into consideration. Here are a few tips that will help you purchase one that will definitely be worth your while.

#### **Whether the phone mount is waterproof**

This way, your phone will still be protected in the wet weather and sunny weather alike. Check out more tips for [riding in the rain](https://mtbnz.com/how-to-ride-your-bike-in-the-rain/).

#### **Whether the mount has a hard case or a soft case**

By and large, hard case phone mounts no doubt happen to be a little bit pricier compared to the soft case mounts. Even so, that doesn’t mean that all is lost for soft cases and neither does it in any way imply that soft cases don’t have their uses. On the contrary, most times you will find that the soft cases happen to be more versatile and hence work with any Smartphone as well as allow touch screen capability which happens to be absent in hard cases.

#### **Whether it has a handlebar mount or a stem cap mount**

In determining exactly what mount to go for it is vital to remember that while a handlebar mount sets your phone on the edge of your sight, the stem cap mounts on the other handsets your phone a bit further out of your periphery hence necessitating you to move your head downwards more obviously. And while this is purely a matter of one’s personal preference, it is still something that one should take into consideration during purchase.

#### **Compatibility with your phone**

Much as most bike phone mounts happen to be universally compatible, that may not be the case with all the bike mounts and more so with the kind of bike mount that you wish to have. It is therefore pertinent to analyze its compatibility beforehand so as to avoid having to ship back the product.

## **Conclusion**

Among all the other available bike mounts in the market, the Vibrelli bike mount takes the cup in as far as performance and reliability are concerned. Although it's very similar to the other products, there are certain features that make it stand out including the clamp and silicone bands that ensure your device's added protection as you cycle away and the special ball and socket design that further enhances its overall flexibility. In addition, it also allows you full access to your phone screen, buttons, and micro jack and hence allows you to use your phone without first having to remove it.
