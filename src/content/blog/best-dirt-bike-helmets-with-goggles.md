## **Best dirt bike helmets with goggles Buying Guide**

![best dirt bike helmet and goggles combo (2)](images/best-dirt-bike-helmet-and-goggles-combo-2.jpg)

Your safety on the tracks or when riding your bike off the road is something that should never be compromised. You need to put into more considering the price and the quality of helmet with goggles before committing to buy.

Most people dwell on the style and class of their protective gear but the most important should be the quality and how well it protects your head in case of an accident. There are some of the things that you should look into before making any purchases and these are;

- Types of helmet
- Size and fit
- Weight
- Advanced protection features
- Budget

### Types of helmets

Helmets come in different types and these are;

- **Open face;** an open face helmet only covers the top, the back and the sides of the head. An open face does not protect your eyes or your chin. The only advantage to this helmet is the view side visibility which is great.

- **Dual sport helmets;** dual sport helmets are awesome for adventure and they double up as on and off the road gear. Most of these dual sport helmets have integrated visors but only a few of them have face shields.
- **Touring motorcycle helmet**; touring motorcycle helmet gear is meant for long distance motorcross or off-road riders. They come with extra chin protection, vent ports and sun visors. Some of these helmets come with a blue tooth speaker system.

- **Modular helmets**; modular helmets are a combination of the full face and open helmet. These helmets are versatile in that you can flip down the lower part and wear it without the chin bar protection
- **Skull caps:** skull caps only protect the head since they only cover the upper part of the head; these are not the best helmets because there is almost no protection.

### **Size and fit**

When getting a helmet, make sure it fits your head properly; a non-fitting helmet hangs loose or it causes pain on your ears and it can cause pain on your neck or ears. The shape of your head contributes a lot to whether the helmet will fit you or not; it is, therefore, wrong to blame a brand for not having the right size.

Most companies are however working round the clock to ensure that they come up with a size that can fit all. Some of these things that determine whether a helmet fits or not is; the material used to make it, the cheek pads as well as the foam liners.

How to get your helmet size

- Place a measuring tape above your ears or one inch above your eyebrows
- Measure your head’s circumference
- Compare your measurements with the ones on the helmet’s sizing charts

### **Ventilation**

When getting the best dirt helmets with goggles, make sure the helmet has enough venting ports. It doesn’t make sense that your head is well protected but you end up suffocating from your sweat or lack of enough air

To ensure that your helmet is always clean and fresh, make sure the foam liners do a good jb of wicking away sweat and any other moisture. You should also ensure that the padding can be removed, cleaned and replaced.

### **Weight**

Riding with heavy helmet on your head is not only uncomfortable but it also cause injuries like a sore neck or neck irritation and sometimes painful ears. Therefore, make sure the best dirt bike helmet with goggles you pick is light in weight; it should weigh less than 3lbs. If you are lucky you might find one that weighs 1.5lbs but make sure the shell is strong like any other to ensure your safety.

However if you find a 4lbs helmet, don’t hesitate to buy it especially if all the other features are excellent.

### **Budget**

We all want to get a good quality helmet because our health is more important than anything else. As much we are not compromising on our safety, you don’t have to rob the bank to get a high end model of helmets. Just ensure that the helmet has all the important features that ensure your head is well covered and protected.

### **Advanced protection features**

A good helmet ensures that you are protected from all sorts of impacts. Some helmets use the multidirectional impact protection technology while others us omnidirectional technology.  Other important features that we might not have talked about are; fully adjustable breakaway visors as well as dirt bike helmet face shield which helps in keeping away dust, wind, rain or snow.

## **Importance of the best dirt bike helmets with goggles**

Unlike vehicles, bikes do not have any structural protection to the riders. Therefore, it is the rider’s duty to get protection gear to protect his body parts with the most important being the head. Even though all body parts are at a risk of harm in case of an accident, the head happens to be the most delicate and it should be protected at all times. A brain injury is paramount to a physical death which means the end of life. You can survive without other body parts like a broken spinal cord or without some limbs like arms or legs but once you have a brain injury, you are as good as dead.

Spending money on a helmet with goggles increases your chances of survival in case of an accident. 60% of all motorists who escape death is as a result of having a helmet on. Goggles also come in handy incase debris that’s fatal to the eyes is involved.

When you get into an accident and you had a helmet on, there is a chance you will have lower health costs as compared to one who didn’t put on a helmet. This is because, as noted above head and brain injuries are quite expensive to treat. Also, having a full protection gear ensures your whole body is protected.

Most insurance companies will not compensate if they get a wind that you did not have your full protection gear especially the helmet when the accident happened. Therefore ensure you are protected every time you are riding your bike.
