When preparing for a triathlon, it’s important to note that cycling is only a third of the total challenge. Training in cycling as well as running and swimming will help you build enough muscles which will help you endure the long distance cycling battle.

The best Road bikes for triathlon are designed with special aerodynamic features that help you overcome thrust offered by air resistance and also balance the high and demands of weight and stiffness.

At any speed, most of your energy goes into overcoming air resistance, so, you need a bike that can reduce drag to ensure that you can ride faster. Most triathlon bikes are slim, so they don’t offer much air resistance, but your body does. This then calls for [non-flappy clothing](https://mtbnz.com/best-mountain-bike-shorts/) that will not drag you back as you ride.

In the manufacturing industry, triathlon bikes have become like the manufacturers' playground. Engineers have taken the freedom to explore radical shapes and designs to enhance the rider’s prowess.

Nonetheless, while aero is the primary design factor, you also need [appropriate training](https://mtbnz.com/how-to-train-for-a-century-ride/), efficient nutrition, and [hydration](https://mtbnz.com/best-hydration-packs-for-mountain-biking/).

## **Steps to Selecting the Best Road Bike for Triathlon**

If you are a beginner in the cycling sport or have done a few triathlons and are looking to buy a new bike for the sport, I have some advice for you.

Entering into the complicated world of cycling can be expensive especially on the [major equipment](https://mtbnz.com/bike-accessories/) that you need, and that’s the bike.

If you look around the fancy designs in shops, you may rush into picking one out blindly without any basic understanding of what you really need and a clear vision of what awaits you in the sport.

There is a strong chance that you will purchase the wrong bike but don’t fear, I am here for you.

Below is a step-by-step guide to making that first big purchase.

### **Set a budget**

Walking into a bicycle shop with no budget can mean getting out of there with no money. Some dealers can take advantage of you. You need to emphasize the equipment you need.

- How much do you intend to spend?
- What kind of bike are you looking for?

You need answers to these questions before you make that big multisport purchase.

### **Understand the choices**

Get a good racing bike that is versatile and durable. Also, note that buying an entry-level racing bike that is upgradable can save you time and money.

Also, be sure your bike is worth upgrading over a reasonable period of time, and when you feel you have outgrown your entry-level bike, find something that will last you for as long as possible.

Different manufacturers have come up with different brands of road triathlon bikes that carry different price tags but have the same designs and can give exactly the same results. This is common in almost every product we buy.

Most manufacturers sell their name and not the uniqueness of their products. If you know what you really need, you can save yourself some money and still get what you want.

### **Check the accessories**

One common mistake among bikers is to exclude accessories from the budget. Check also the cost of accessories and put it in your budget. Some of the most basic accessories include;

- Frame pump
- Patch kit
- Spare tubes
- [Helmet](https://mtbnz.com/best-mountain-bike-helmets/)
- [Clothing](https://mtbnz.com/bike-apparel/) (shorts, jerseys, jacket)
- [Gloves](https://mtbnz.com/best-mountain-bike-gloves/)
- [Cycling shoes](https://mtbnz.com/best-mtb-shoes-for-flat-pedals/)
- [Clipless pedals](https://mtbnz.com/best-mountain-bike-pedals/)
- Aerobars
- [Sunglasses.](https://mtbnz.com/best-cycling-sunglasses/)

You can set a budget at $5000 for your bike and end up spending almost the same amount on these accessories. But are they necessary?

It’s a racing bike, this sport comes with its unique requirements, and these rider’s accessories are very essential.

You can’t race without a helmet, and you need the comfort and the safety of the cycling shorts, jerseys, gloves, and other necessities. If you want to transport your bicycle in your car, you need an [appropriate bicycle rack](https://mtbnz.com/bike-racks/).

## **Factors to Consider When Buying the Best Road Bike For Triathlon**

### **Geometry**

The purpose of any bike is mostly influenced by its geometry. Triathlon bikes are no exception. Triathletes need to be comfortable for a long period of time in the aerodynamic position and also be able to run long distances once off the bike.

Due to this, the seat tube angle and the top tuber length distinguishes the triathlon bikes from others. Triathlon bikes have a much steeper seat tube angle than ordinary road bikes, typically starting at 74 to 80 degrees.

This large forward push recruits more gluts and hamstrings through the pedal stroke, saving the quadriceps for the run leg of the race. It also allows riders to adopt an aggressive aerodynamic position and reduce their frontal profile.

A longer top tube and an elongated reach is another distinct feature of triathlon bikes. This aims to stretch the rider, putting them in a more aggressive, horizontal position that improves their aerodynamics. This ensures that the rider’s weight is evenly distributed between the wheels.

### **Aerodynamics**

Aerodynamics are a key component of triathlon bikes as those small advantages gained adds up over hours on end in the saddle. Most of the triathlon courses are flat with very few hills, weight isn’t much of a concern.

One way to enhance aerodynamics is by using oversized tube profiles, this helps the wind pass along the bike without deviation, which otherwise would cause turbulent air flow and increase drag. This is commonly seen on the front forks, downtube, and seat tube.

Another way manufacturers improve the bikes aerodynamic efficiency is to integrate things like brakes, cables, and storage.

Brakes for triathlon bikes are commonly found behind the forks or hidden behind fairings at the front of the bike or at the rear of the bike, they are located underneath the bottom bracket area or out of the wind in partial tube cutouts on the seatstays.

Internal cables are common on the majority of bikes that also improves aerodynamics and reducing the chance of them getting damaged by environmental factors.

An altered frame shape also helps in enhancing aerodynamics. Some feature a dropped downtube to reduce the space between the downtube and front wheel improving airflow.

Dropped seatstays also helps to limit the frontal area contacting the wind and reduces drag as a result. Some brands have removed the seatstays altogether for the same advantage.

The [wheels](https://mtbnz.com/best-mountain-bike-wheels/) also are another way of enhancing aerodynamics for triathlon bikes. Generally, the deeper wheel profile leads to more improved aerodynamics.

This has a disadvantage because it makes the bike harder to handle given, it will be more affected by the side wind than a shallow slim. The extra material required also creates a harsher ride by not offering as much comfort as a shallow wheel.

### **Integration and storage**

I have touched on the integration of brakes and cables to enhance aerodynamics, but the integration of storage systems for tools, fluids, and food is also very important. In the past, triathlon bikes had many modifications like rear [water bottle holders](https://mtbnz.com/best-hydration-packs-for-mountain-biking/), saddlebags, and chunky storage cases on the top tube for food and the sticky taping gel packets onto the top tubes.

Modern triathlon bikes are much more improved with storage solutions, integrating them into the bike design thus eliminating the need for retrofitted parts.

### **Comfort**

Comfort is crucial when riding any bike, even more for a triathlon. Long distance events go even beyond 90km. This long-distance solo riding could take you for more than two hours.

There is also an added run off the bike for a minimum distance of 20km. For such a sport, the importance of comfort cannot be overlooked. The triathlon bikes with specialized geometry help with that but there are other essential comfort considerations to take when making the purchase. Let us look at some of them.

- Adjustability: Different triathletes have different body shapes, composition, flexibility, and mobility. Being able to adequately adjust your bike is crucial. Choosing the right bike size is the first step, and from there, being able to easily adjust your position will help your performance to the end.
- Saddle: Triathlon specific saddles are created to give room for a more aggressive, bent over position on the bike with utmost anterior pelvic tilt. They are often shorter than traditional saddles with a cutout section in the middle to tackle the pressure off the soft tissue of the pelvis that would be compressed if you used a normal saddle.
- Shape of extensions: The shape of the TT extension is also crucial in improving comfort. Extensions can be straight, curved or pointing upwards depending on your preference. This aims at keeping your wrist in a neutral position and achieve right angles at your elbow and shoulders. It provides good levels of structural support for your upper body and won’t impinge any nerves or restrict blood flow.

### **Gearing**

When it comes to triathlon road bikes, we focus on either electronic or mechanical gearing system. The electronic option allows you to change gears from both the TT extensions and the brake bars.

If you decide to go for electronic one, make sure you charge it as required to avoid flat batteries during the event. On the gear ratio side, you will need gears with a wider range as the length of the race increases.
