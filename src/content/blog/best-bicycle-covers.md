When left unprotected outdoors, your bicycle can deteriorate faster than you could ever imagine.  Rain, snow and UV rays from the sun can have you see visible signs of damage in as little as a week.

Generally speaking, the more humid your area is, the faster your bike will deteriorate when left outdoors.

Hot temperatures cause the plastic and rubber components of your bike to become brittle and break. Your tubes and tires will crack and may pop when pressure is applied.

Exposure to the sun may cause the frame, [seats](https://mtbnz.com/best-kids-bike-seats/), and [pedals](https://mtbnz.com/best-mountain-bike-pedals/) to lose color and have the bike looking old.

When it is cold and wet, your metallic parts will rust quickly and seize up when not lubricated frequently and adequately. For these reasons, you should invest in some of the best bicycle covers in the market.

![bicycle covers waterproof](images/bicycle-covers-waterproof.jpg)

Bicycle covers are simple accessories that help to keep your bike in good working condition when you cannot avoid outdoor storage. While the purpose of the bike cover is straightforward and simple, there are several things you have to consider to ensure that you have chosen the right one for your needs.

### The Size of Your Bike

Before you buy the bike cover, you have to make sure that it is big enough for your bike. Bicycle covers come in different sizes and you need to ensure that it will cover your entire bike.

The last thing you want is for you to buy a cover that only covers half of your bike.

The other half will end up being damaged and thus render the entire bike useless. A cover that is too big may not be as much of a hassle as one that is small. However, it is important for you to ensure that the cover is fitting so that it covers your bike from top to bottom without much of a problem.

### Closure system of bicycle covers

Most people make the mistake of only covering part of the bike. Once the cover has covered the exterior of the bike, most people will leave it at that. However, when it rains water tends to accumulate at the bottom of the bike and cause rusting.

You, therefore, need to ensure that the cover you buy has a closure system. the closure system may be buttons, tie straps or a sipper. This feature will prevent any water or dust from getting on the bike and causing damage. Covers with some type of closure system are easier to handle and are safer since they cover every part of the bike.

The material make therefore needs to be high-quality and impressive. This will allow it to protect your bike for a long time without getting damaged or letting weather elements to reach your bike.

### Weatherproof (Waterproof, dust proof and breathable)

Waterproof bicycle covers are meant to protect your bike from harsh weather elements. They are also supposed to be breathable such that they allow moisture to escape when it is hot and prevent water from getting in during the rainy season.

A great bicycle cover will also keep dust from getting to your bike. When you uncover your bike, therefore, it should be exactly as you left it, clean and usable.

### Lightweight

You don’t want to always call people to help you cover your bike. The cover that you buy must be easily to use and light weight. This means you can cover and uncover your bike yourself without worrying about the cover weight too much. A cover that is too heavy may cause your bike to fall when it is packed in an upright position. A lightweight cover is also easily portable in case you have to carry the cover around without when you travel to when you go out and have to keep your bike covered.

### Bicycle Covers Cost

In these tough economic times, you need to ensure that you are not using more money than you have to get what you need. Cheap is not always expensive when it comes to bicycle covers.

There are numerous companies out there that offer high quality bicycle covers at an affordable price. There are some expensive brands in the market that still allow you to get what you need.
