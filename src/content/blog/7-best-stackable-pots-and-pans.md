Calphalon is designed with optimum non-stick properties that guarantee effortless cooking. It releases food fast, thus ensuring that your meals do not stick on the pan. 

However, we advise that you **use low-medium heat** if you want to get the best results. We realized that using high temperatures results in sticking and can consequently lead to dark spots on the pan.

If you intend to buy space-saving cookware, you should evaluate your needs before settling for the best stackable pots and pans set in the market. Some of the questions that you should answer before stepping out to shop include:

- What do you need the stackable pots and pans sets for?
- What is the size of your kitchen? Do you have kitchen cabinets?
- What stovetop are you using? 
- Are they stackable? 

### **Shopping Based on Need**

If you intend to buy stack cooking pots for camping, we recommend that you buy lightweight cookware that you can carry without a hassle. Additionally, camping cookware must be versatile for use in [open fires](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outdoor_cooking).

### **Stackability** 

To get value for money, we recommend that you buy cookware that has detachable handles. This way, you will be guaranteed stackability that will surely save your space. Such pots and pans will fit in your cabinet and countertop space without a hassle. 

### **Your Stovetop**

When shopping, you should be careful to consider pots and pans that are compatible with your stovetop. You should be keen if you are using an induction hob. Most cookware sets are not compatible with induction cooktops! 

### **Type of Lids**

To get the best stackability, we recommend that you get pots and pans with flat lids.

## Tips on How to Care for Stackable Pots 

One of the biggest worries among homeowners is that their stackable pots and pans will crack due to frequent friction. While this is possible, there are several tips that you can use to care for these pots and eliminate the risk. They include:

- **Be Gentle.** When stacking your pots and pans, you should always be gentle. Avoid banging your pots or using unnecessarily high pressure when storing them.
- **Use a Paper Towel or Dish Towel.** If your stackable pots are prone to scratches, you should use a paper towel to form a barrier between the stacked cookware. This will prevent direct contact, thus minimizing the risk of scratches and cracks. 
- **Clean the Pots After Use.** You should always clean your pots immediately after use. However, we recommend that you avoid abrasive materials. Instead, use a soft sponge, warm water, and soap to wipe off the debris.
- **Dry Your Pans.** Before storing your pans, you should always ensure that your pans are dry. 

Additionally, we advise that you do not store [cast iron cookware](https://thekitchenpot.com/lodge-cast-iron-skillet-review/) together with your stackable cookware. Instead, learn [how to store cookware here](https://www.wikihow.com/Store-Cast-Iron-Cookware).
