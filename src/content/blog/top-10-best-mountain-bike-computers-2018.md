With so many mountain bike computers in the market and all of them proclaiming themselves as the best, it can be a tad hard to buy the best mountain bike computers if you do not get some information first. However, with our detailed reviews, you should find the best easily.

We all have our different reasons as to why we want to buy the best mountain bike computers and most of these reasons revolve around monitoring speed, heart rate, logging cycling data, tracking routes, etc.  All these functions can be combined and instead of having multiple devices to keep track of the data you can opt to for a mountain bike computer.

And why a mountain bike computer? Simply because mountain bike computers have all these functions and many more integrated into their systems. They are also reasonably priced, convenient and you get to connect your device to your smartphone. You also get to share your experiences with friends and family.

## 10 Best Cycling Computer Reviews

When it comes to cycling computers, they span the range from simple to complex.  Some display only speed, distance and time.  Others generate a wealth of downloadable data to track every detail of routine training. 

Yet, the best will perform these tasks with minimal fuss, leaving you to focus on your ride.  And while the Garmin Edge 500 isn’t perfect, it excels by being incredibly simple to set-up and use, even among multiple bikes. 

### Garmin Edge 500 “Bundle”

The Garmin Edge 500 “Bundle” comes with the head unit, two handlebar mounts, a combination speed/cadence sensor, and an upgraded heart rate monitor.  The head unit is approximately 1.9 inches wide, 2.7 inches long, and 0.9 inches thick and weighs in at a very modest 57 grams (2 ounces). 

Since it’s waterproof, including the silicone covered buttons, getting caught in the rain won’t be an issue.  The display is a rather basic black/white LCD but is fully configurable and can display up to eight metrics at one time…or just one… but five seems about right.  There are however three pages of data, displaying current information, another with averages, and the last with maximum values.   

All the data, displayed or not, is available for download via USB cable after your ride.  There is enough memory to store up to 180 hours of ride data, but the rechargeable battery lasts only about 15-18 hours.  The head unit is also ANT+ compatible and can be used with other manufacturer’s sensors and power meters.

Set-up is straightforward, involving attaching the mount backed with a rubber gasket to your handlebar by means of two rubber o-rings.  The head unit then inserts into the mount sideways and a 90 degree twist locks it in place.  Admittedly, the mount doesn’t seem the most secure, but attachment is solid and ease of transferring between bikes has never been easier.  I will point out that the mount is not suitable for triathlon bikes since there is limited space between aerobars.  Since the attachment requires a twist, the width required is the better part of 3.5 inches (9 cm).  So, for triathletes, the Garmin will likely wind up on the top tube or, depending upon shape, actually attached to the aerobar itself.

The Garmin uses GPS satellites to determine your location and speed.  However, the timing signal from the satellites occurs only once a second and as such isn’t very accurate for determining speed, especially if you are under tree cover (think mountain biking) or have interference from the next generation mobile broadband transmissions (see **LightSquared Issues**)  As a result your exact speed and therefore total distance won’t be calculated quite right.  As such, Garmin offers the GSC 10, an optional cadence and speed sensor.

The sensor is very well thought out and was easy to install on the rear chain stay.  Cadence is determined off a magnet attached to the inside of the crank arm, and similarly, speed is determined off a magnet attached to a spoke on the rear wheel.  What makes the set-up delightful is that the sensor has a test button which flashes if the magnet is positioned appropriately (red for cadence, green for speed).  The entire set-up can be performed in a few minutes and without having to change positions a dozen times fiddling with the precise magnet position.

Lastly, the bundled package comes with an upgraded heart rate monitor halter strap.  The strap is simply the standard elastic band with size adjustment clips.  But what makes the monitor different is that the heart rate sensors embedded within the band are limited to two rather small areas.  As such the strap is much more flexible and conforms better to the body. 

So if you’ve had trouble with halter strap type heart rate monitors in the past (women, I’m specifically talking to you) this strap is likely to work.  Additionally, the plastic transmitter portion of the heart rate monitor which contains the battery is removal via two metal snaps, allowing the elastic band to be washed.   Battery replacement is simple, but the battery needs to be removed for several minutes to fully discharge the device’s memory.  Failure to do so will cause odd, intermittent issues with the function of the sensor.

#### **_Garmin Connect_**

In order to fully utilize the wealth of data on the Garmin Edge 500, you will need to use Garmin’s free internet based data service.  Basically, you’ll need to sign up for an account.  Once logged in, you can connect the Garmin via USB cable to your computer and upload data, either all data on the device or a specific ride.  Garmin’s server-side software then formats and displays the data in an organized manner.  A few screenshots are provided below.

#### _**Summary**_

The Garmin Edge 500 bundle is a well thought out and highly usable cycling computer package.  It’s not cheap, and if you aren’t interested in logging data or seeing maps of your rides, then it may not be for you.  However, its simple, it works, and presents well.  Set-up is easy and the unit travels seamlessly between bike (can chose multiple set-ups if different bikes have different sensors or lack any sensors).

#### _**Misses:**_

- Battery life is fine for routine rides, either on the road or in the woods.  Downloading data with a USB cable is also the method of charging.  However, if you happen to do multi-day tours and may not have access to a computer, you’ll want to buy a USB charger such as Apple’s **little cube** charger.
- No touch screen.  No graphics.  No ability to display a map while riding.  This would be really helpful, especially for trail riding.  Garmin makes a color, touchscreen device that shows maps and designed for trail rides.  The **Garmin Edge 800** however, has a heavy price tag:  $449 for the base model.

## Choosing the Best Mountain Bike Computers

### Types of MTB Computers

Mountain bike computers are classified into two main categories:

1. GPS-enabled Computers
2. Non-GPS Bike Computers

GPS-enabled computers relay more accurate measurements of both speed and distance since they use GPS signals as opposed to wired sensors. This means that the data is more detailed than that collected using non-GPS bike computers

Most GPS-enabled computers are compatible with phones or computers which allows you to important information like speed and distance.

When it comes to non-GPS bike computers they are mostly beneficial in measuring temperatures, cadence, and heart rate. They use wired sensors to measure speed and distance covered.

### Battery Life

Battery is one of the most important features to look for when shopping for the best mountain bike computers. You want a battery a full ride on a single charge or even better a battery than last for not just one ride but several.

### Ease of Use

You want to buy a mountain bike computer that is easy to configure and use. The ideal mountain bike computer should have an easy setup and its functionality should not be complex. The navigation should be smooth and the important features should be easy to access. That said Garmin products should be high up on your list if you are looking for an mtb computer that’s easy to use.

Startup Time

If you opt for GPS mountain bike computers it is advisable that you check the startup time. You want a computer that does not take long to acquire satellites. The faster a computer is the better. Once your mtb computer acquires the satellites, you can hop onto your bike and ride into the forests or mountains.

### Water Resistance

### Features

You need to figure out the exact features that will be of use to you. And since mountain bike computers come with a ton load of features, your ‘list’ of features will help you make the right decision.

Some of the key features include; stress score, data collection method, live tracker, smartphone connectivity, ANT+ compatibility, Bluetooth compatibility, mapping and route options.

Conclusion

Hopefully this information will be of use to you in your quest to find the best mountain bike computer.
