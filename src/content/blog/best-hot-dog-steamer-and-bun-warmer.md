In this case, you should choose a wheeled hot dog steamer and bun warmer. Alternatively, you can choose conveniently small cookware that you can carry around with ease. 

**Lid Cover** 

Your best hot dog steamer and bun warmer should always have a lid cover. This guarantees an efficient heat distribution, thus ensuring that your hot dogs cook evenly. 

Also, ensure that the lid has a handle for efficiency when checking the progress of your hot dogs and buns. Additionally, some may even have transparent lids for ease of assessing your meals. 

**Efficiency**

How fast do you want your best hot dog steamer and bun warmer to take cooking your meal? Different types of burner have different cooking times. Always ensure that you only choose those that meet your needs effectively.

**Durability**

The materials used for construction determines how durable your best hot dog steamer and bun warmer is. Sturdy materials will guarantee a long-lasting product! 

**Thermostat and Motor**

Additionally, an easily adjustable thermostat guarantees that you get well-cooked hot dogs and buns. It helps you to set the ideal temperatures and time, thus preventing overcooking.

**How Easy is it to Clean?**

If your best hot dog steamer and bun warmer can have a dishwasher-safe tray, the better it’ll be for you. It’ll be easy to disassemble and clean up.
