For the third time in a row, I've picked the [DMR Vault Flat Pedals](https://www.amazon.com/DMR-Vault-BMX-Pedal-black/dp/B005U5WIYG/ref=as_li_ss_il?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=B005U5WIYG&pd_rd_r=P4KS7FC0DJYXRTQY61Y4&pd_rd_w=49Bjv&pd_rd_wg=qv76f&psc=1&refRID=P4KS7FC0DJYXRTQY61Y4&linkCode=li3&tag=furiousbikes-20&linkId=c8a48d3b65f4143a1591cc6b16396a8f) as my best mountain bike pedals.

Surprisingly, if you ask bike journalists and versatile riders, they will also recommend the DMR vaults because of the unparalleled quality. Ever since these pedals were pioneered, they have been improved to suit the needs of a mountain biker.

The DMR Vaults weigh around 400 grams which is an ideal weight for trail riders. Additionally, they have a thickness of around 17mm and they feature a concave shape that is perfect for your flat pedal-specific shoes. The other good thing is that they have a wide platform area of 115 x 115 mm.

I have used these mountain bike pedals for 2 years and I can testify that they have an amazing grip, thanks to their durable hexagonal shaped pins. These alloy thru-pins can be replaced easily since they use an M4 thread.

Another awesome feature about the vaults is their durable construction. The pedal bodies are CNC milled making them tough for all conditions.

The finishing is also on point. You might even think they feature a Teflon topcoat due to their resistance to abrasion.

In case you are that rider who lives for the descents, then you definitely need to grab a pair of the DMR Vault Flat Pedals. They never disappoint!!!

##  How To Choose The Best MTB Pedals

“I always have a hard time choosing the best mountain bike pedals” is what beginners always complain about. Of course, it will not be an easy task choosing bike pedals if you do not know what you should consider. 

Fortunately, there are a few tips that I’m going to walk you through so that you are able to make the right decision.

### Consider the type of pedals you want

As discussed earlier, there exist three types of pedals which include the clipless, combo and platform/flat MTB pedals.

By now you should know that each type is designed to suit a certain type of bike. If you are looking to buy pedals for your mountain bike, it is advisable that you buy the flat pedals because they are easy to use.

### Check for Durability aspects

Unless you are really old to ride frequently, your pedals will be exposed to rough conditions and treatment. For this reason, it is imperative to buy a pedal that will withstand extreme tree brushing.

Of course, it’s always good to keep your bike clean to increase durability. Unfortunately, some bike pedals will rust when exposed to water. This is why you need to ensure that your pedals will not rust easily. Invest in pedals that can last you for more than 2 years of heavy riding.

### Choose The Best MTB Pedals That are Easy to Clean

This factor goes hand in hand with durability. The best mountain bike pedals tend to hold grime better than ordinary pedals.  The design of pedals will tell you if it’s easy to clean them or not. Always ensure that you pick a pedal that requires little or no maintenance.

### Check for Adjustability on the MTB Pedals

The most important question you should ask yourself is if the pedals are easy to click out. Do the pedals allow you to move your legs naturally when pedaling?  Pick pedals that will enhance freedom of motion and those that are comfortable for downhill and cross country riding.

## Types of Mountain Bike Pedals

### MTB flat Pedals

I am sure you are familiar with the regular pedals you see on most bikes. These type features a flat surface where your feet steps on. These pedals are designed in many shapes, materials and styles.

Most of the MTB flat pedals will have a price range of around 20$-50$; this means they are easily replaceable in case of damage.

Manufacturers have come up with high-end fat pedals that will cost you around 50-100 bucks.  Good thing is that they come fitted with spikes that provide good grip.

In most cases you’ll find out that these pedals are built using lightweight alloys. Besides, it comes with high-quality ball bearings that are replaceable and serviceable.

#### Pros

- They are quite affordable

- Compatible with all kinds of shoes

- Allows you to bail of the bike when necessary

- Great for beginners and downhill cycling

#### Cons

- They are less efficient

### MTB Clipless Pedals

Are you familiar with the concept of a ski boot binding? If yes, you might have noted that clipless pedals apply a similar mechanism. The pedals are designed to hold or clip your foot on the pedal when cycling. When riding using these pedals, you can unclamp your cycling shoes by twisting the heel outwards.

![clipless pedals](images/clipless-pedals.jpg)

#### What is so special about Clipless pedals?

With clipless pedals, you don’t have to worry about your legs slipping of the pedals when mountain biking or riding on smooth roads.

Secondly, they allow cyclists to practice and perfect the most efficient pedaling method. How? By helping cyclists apply consistent and even pressure throughout a pedal stroke.

The clipless pedal has two main parts which includes:

- Actual pedals

- The cleats (the parts that attaches to the cycling-specific shoes)

![best clipless pedals](images/speedplay-frog-pedal.jpg)

#### Advantages

- **_Comfort & even power transfer_**: clipless pedals allow cyclists to have a steady pedal stroke. This implies that you will not require flexing your foot a lot thus improving foot comfort.

- **_Allowing easy hoping & lifting:_** Clipless pedals allow cyclists make small hops and jumps easily. On the other hand, it is not good to rely on them to practice bunny hops.

- **_Minimizing shifting feet:_** Clipless pedals are designed to hold your feet well even on rough terrain. This means that your feel will rarely slip when peddling.

#### Disadvantages

**_Clogging up easily:_** They clog up easily during extreme conditions such as snow or ice

**_Easy to fall:_** with clipless pedals, you might forget to unclip your legs when you need to stop. This will definitely lead to a funny slow-motion fall.

### How to Choose the Best Clipless MTB Pedals

**C**ertain things in our lives that have become so pervasive, it's hard to imagine ever not having them-ATMs for example. They're everywhere now, and credit card companies advertise, "Accepted at over 1 million ATMs!" or some such number. But we can all remember when you just had to wait until the bank was open to get cash.

For cyclists, clipless pedals are the same way. Most of us can remember riding in clips and straps and making that step toward clipless pedals with great trepidation. If you're like me, you probably even wondered what the hell you were thinking buying these death traps, as you lay sprawled on the pavement at a stoplight, unable to clip out. Even on organized tours many riders have a nifty pedal-and-shoe "system." But just 12 years after Look debuted the first widely accepted clipless pedal, it's hard to imagine riding those old rat traps. The days of desperation track stands at stoplights because you forgot to loosen the toe straps are over.

#### **Drilling for Cleats**

Since that first pedal from Look, many manufacturers have joined the clipless market, introducing a myriad of cleat bolt patterns that threaten to make your shoe soles resemble carbon-fiber Swiss cheese.

So what is best?

The truth is, all of these designs are proven performers, but what pedal and shoe you end up with is largely dependent on what kind of riding you do. The Look-style (three-bolt) pedals incorporate a large triangular platform for stability and support during long rides. (Look closely at the Motorola team. They're not riding SPDs, but the older Look-style Dura-Ace platforms.)

SPD, for Shimano Pedaling Dynamics, was originally invented for mountain biking. A small cleat was necessary to minimize cleat contact with the ground during hike-a-bike sections and to maximize the amount of tread on the shoe sole. This design is especially popular for the noncompetitive rider who spends time off the bike. Most recessed-cleat shoes (those that allow the rider to walk without damaging the cleats) are drilled for the two-bolt SPD pattern. Don't think that SPDs aren't a performance item, though, as many of the pedals in this style we tested are made to accommodate the racer. The odd men out, as it were, are companies such as Time, Diadora and the Merckx Podio. These use their own bolt patterns that require a dedicated shoe drilling or special adapter plate.

#### **Float Like a...Foot?**

I don't think Muhammad Ali had biomechanics in mind when he uttered his famous quote, but float is a big issue in the pedal world. Float is a rotational movement of the cleat in the pedal that allows free movement in the heel. The range of float varies between 1 and 30 degrees depending on the manufacturer. It should be noted that float in its original usage denoted full lateral movement of the foot on the pedal, with no pivot point. Now the term generically refers to heel rotation.

Do you need float? Maybe, maybe not. Float and rotation are based on the discovery that some riders' knees move laterally during the pedal stroke. If locked into a fixed system, the lateral movement strains tendons and ligaments in the hip, knee and ankle joints. These are the riders who absolutely need a floating system. Some of us (a larger segment of riders than you'd think), however, have knees that don't rock around as much

#### **Weights & Measures**

In many cases, manufacturers offer more than one pedal, so we asked them for their best-selling model and a budget-oriented platform. For some makers, these were one and the same. Our review is not exhaustive but does represent the selection available. Omitted models share many of the same features as their reviewed brethren. The category "release tension" denotes my impressions of the ease of entry and exit from the pedal at both the lowest and highest retention settings. We've also included a criterion often overlooked: platform size. This is an important consideration, as it will help you choose a pedal and shoe that's right for your riding style. For SPD-style platforms, we measured the platform size with the "pontoons" that come with SPD cleats installed.

For the weight weenies out there, do not be swayed simply by the promise of lighter gear. To pick the pedal that's right for you, consider what you're doing on the bike. Tourists don't need the lightest, trickest design out there, and crit racers don't need the largest platform available. Consider the shoes that are available and fit your feet the best to be sure they're drilled for the pedals you want. Buy what's appropriate for your riding style.

## Conclusion

In summation, I believe that our guide will help you choose the best mountain bike pedals with ease. There are a lot of pedals that exist in the market but we were only able to review those that we've tested.

Our choices are the best for both beginners and pro mountain bikers. _In case you are interested in other MTB gear, check out our comprehensive guide on the [**best mountain bike shoes**](http://mtbnz.com/best-mountain-bike-shoes/), &_ [**_best mountain bike helmets_**](http://mtbnz.com/best-mountain-bike-helmets/)
