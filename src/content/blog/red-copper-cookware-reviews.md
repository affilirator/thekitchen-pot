Many red copper cookware reviews portray red copper pans and pots as the gold standard for nonstick cookware. However, we’ve all learned to take these adverts and reviews with a pinch of salt – sometimes they can be misleading and inaccurate.

So, is red copper cookware non-stick? Is red copper cookware as seen on TV genuine? 

Going through customers’ reviews on Amazon, there are mixed reactions on the efficacy, performance, responsiveness, and ease of cleaning of these pans. 

We set out to find whether there is any truth in red copper TV infomercials. Here is our brutally honest red copper cookware reviews.

## Red Copper Pans Construction – What are They Made Of?

Many infomercials for red copper cookware are designed to convince you that these pans have a copper advantage. You’d be forgiven to think that they are perfect.

But is the red copper pan really made of copper?

Well, not exactly! 

These pans have a negligible percentage of copper metal, which explains their affordability. You cannot get **[pure copper cookware](https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=1704740&u=2750617&m=106011&urllink=&afftrack=)** anywhere at the price of these red copper pans (some even below $100 for a set).

So, what are red copper pans made of?

These pans are constructed using **aluminum but have a copper-infused ceramic nonstick coating**. As such, they are largely your ordinary aluminum pan, but with an attractive copper polish on the outer layer. 

Therefore, you shouldn’t be misled that red copper pans are equal to **[pure copper cookware](https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=1704740&u=2750617&m=106011&urllink=&afftrack=)**; they are a world apart.

However, you can still buy the red copper pans and pots if you need a nonstick pan. It has an advantage over Teflon-coated pans.

Unlike Teflon nonstick pans, the red copper cookware is safe, even when used in an oven. It does not contain PFOA and PTFE.

### 1. [**BulbHead Red Copper 10 PC Copper-Infused Ceramic Non-Stick Cookware Set**](https://www.amazon.com/BulbHead-10824-Copper-Infused-Non-Stick-Cookware/dp/B01MRI635K?tag=kitchenpot-20)

Unlike Teflon-coated nonstick pans, the BulbHead Red Copper set is oven safe up to 500 degrees Fahrenheit. It does not react with your food, thus guaranteeing safety. 

However, you should be careful when using a metallic spatula since it can scratch the cooking surface. If the scratches are too many, you risk losing the nonstick coating, which will result in undesirable cooking experiences.

This combination of pots and pans makes it ideal for both novice and professional chefs. It doesn’t matter whether you need to fry your eggs, saute your veggies, or boil your pasta, the set will serve you right. 

When you receive your set, you should always season it. If you don’t, you will not get its exceptional nonstick cooking. Additionally, we found that the pan lost its seasoning quite fast. As such, we recommend that you season it regularly to get the best results. 

Additionally, washing the pans with harsh scrubbers will compromise their quality. You should also not use a dishwasher.

Instead, we recommend that you hand wash it using warm and soapy water. Use a sponge to wipe off the debris and then rinse using clean water. Always ensure that you dry them before storage. 

Before buying the Red Copper Cookware set, you should note the following:

-   If you use abrasive cleaning methods, the nonstick layer will be destroyed in as little as 2 months. As such, you should STRICTLY use a sponge, warm water, and soap to clean your pans.
-   Do not use a metallic spatula, whisks, spoons, or anything else that can scratch the surface. The copper-infused ceramic coating is prone to scratches

If you follow these instructions, you can be sure that the BulbHead Red Copper cookware will offer affordable and quality cooking moments.

## Red Copper Cookware Reviews – Comprehensive Buying Guide

When you step out to buy red copper cookware, you’re likely to be overwhelmed by the many brands available in the market. 

First, it is crucial to note that there is a **[difference](https://www.simplyhealthyfamily.org/copper-chef-vs-red-copper/) between red copper/ copper-coated cookware and copper cookware.** 

When a manufacturer indicates that their pans are made out of red copper, it means that the set consists of aluminum/ stainless steel and a ceramic-copper coating. On the other hand, copper pots and pans are made of pure copper coated with tin. 

In this particular guide, we are discussing the **RED COPPER COOKWARE**. Are these pans good? Is the red copper coating safe? Let’s find out:

![Are red copper pans and pots nonstick?](images/portablegasgrill.jpg)

### **Factors to Consider When Buying Red Copper Pans** 

Wondering how to choose the right red copper cookware set from the plethora of options available? Well, the first trick is not to rush. Take your time and compare the various brands in the market.

The two major brands available include BulbHead and Copper Chef red copper pans. However, this does not mean that they are the only options. You will get many others, and the best choice for you will be determined by the following factors:

**1\. Your Needs** 

Do you want a single red copper pan, skillet, or pot? Or do you want all of them as a set? This consideration is important since it can save you a few bucks.

If you buy a set, you’re likely to spend less than when buying each item individually. However, it would also not make economic sense to buy a set while you only need a pan and a skillet. 

As such, weigh your needs. If you feel that your kitchen needs a facelift by replacing all the pans and pots, then going for a cookware set is the best bet. 

2\. **Design and Construction**

If you value elegance, then this factor is crucial. The appearance of the pans will determine how aesthetic they will be in your kitchen. If you want colored pans, then you should determine the color you need. Some come with a red finish while others are graying or darker. 

Additionally, the type of handles used and their construction determines the ergonomics of the pans. If you can, we recommend that you get pans with riveted handles for guaranteed strength and versatility. A stay-cool feature will, undoubtedly, be an added advantage. 

**3\. Cookware Set Size**

The size of the set will depend on the size of your family. For example, a single individual living on a budget should not sacrifice all their resources on a 23-set cookware set. While it would appear cool, it would sincerely be a waste of resources. 

As such, a single individual should consider buying single items or buy a relatively smaller red copper cookware set (such as a 6-piece).

**4\. Shape and Size**

Red copper cookware sets come in different shapes and sizes. You can get square, oval, and square pots and pans. 

As such, you should choose one that is shaped to suit your needs. The choice will purely be based on personal needs and preferences. 

## **How to Clean Copper Pans** 

While it is necessary to clean your pan after every use, you should let it cool first. Adding cold water to a pan directly from the fire may result in damage.

After cooling, you should continue with the cleaning process as outlined in the steps below. 

-   **Wipe off Excess Oil.** You should always wipe the residual oil and debris using a paper towel or a soft cloth. 
-   **Soak the Pan in Warm Soapy Water.** After using the pan, you should flood it with warm, soapy water and let it sit for 5 minutes. 
-   **Scrub the Pan.** After soaking, you should use a sponge to clean the pans. Never use abrasive pads/cleaners since they will damage the ceramic-copper nonstick layer

**1\. Cleaning Tough Residues**

If you’re dealing with stubborn stains, you can easily be tempted to use an abrasive pad. But don’t fall for it! If you do, you will destroy the nonstick layer and the efficacy of the pan will greatly be compromised. 

Instead, you should follow the following steps:

-   Soak the pans in warm, soapy water for 5 minutes
-   Add baking soda to the stained areas and leave for 20 more minutes
-   Scrub with a friendly/plastic dish brush. Be gentle.
-   Rinse with lukewarm water

This trick will help you to clean red copper pans without destroying the non-stick layer. It is the main differentiator between positive and negative reviews of these pans. Individuals using abrasive pads will always complain of sticking pots and pans. 

**2\. Cleaning the Bottom of Red Copper Pan**

Cleaning the bottom of your pan without compromising its aesthetics can be tricky. Many people tend to be harsh with the outer layer, which leaves ugly scratches on the surface.

If you need to get rid of these stains without destroying your pan’s appearance, you should use vinegar. In some instances, you can mix it with salt.

Sprinkle this mixture (white vinegar and salt) and let it soak for 5-10 minutes. You should then scrub with a plastic brush (avoid abrasive versions). You should then rinse it with lukewarm water. 

Alternatively, you can use tomatoes instead of vinegar. The citric acid in the vegetable dissolves the debris and loosens them making it easy to remove. If you do it well, it will leave a shiny surface with no scratches whatsoever. 

**3\. Drying Your Pans**

Once you’re through with cleaning, you should dry your red copper pans using a soft kitchen towel. 

## How to Season Your Red Copper Pans

Failure to **[season your red copper pans](https://thekitchenpot.com/blog/how-to-season-red-copper-pan//)** can result in a frustrating cooking experience. In most cases, this omission will make you curse the day you bought the pans, quite literally. It will lead to the burning of food and difficult cleaning!

As such, you should be careful to [season your copper pans](https://www.wikihow.com/Season-a-Red-Copper-Pan) to get the best out of them. But why is seasoning important? Well, the process fills tiny spaces on the surface of the pans, which boosts their non-stick properties. 

To get the best out of your red copper pans, we recommend that you follow these steps to season your pans without a hassle:

-   Wash your pans with warm, soapy water and rinse them thoroughly
-   Wipe the pans dry using a soft towel
-   Coat the inner surface using a light layer of vegetable oil (such as canola or olive oil)
-   Preheat your oven at 300 degrees F
