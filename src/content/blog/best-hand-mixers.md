Even before you step out to shop, you should always ensure that you ask yourself one crucial questions:

### **What are My Needs?**

Answering this question with utmost honesty will help you to avoid overspending due to features that you may never use.

Always remember that the more features a product has, the costlier it will be. Therefore, you should always evaluate the usefulness of each of the features before purchasing your product.

### **But Why Are Hand Mixers Important?**

Well, it’s easy to think that hand mixers are only meant for individuals who cannot afford the rather complex standing mixers. But how correct is this?

Well, I’ll tell you that that is wrong!

Some tasks are easier accomplished when using the best hand mixers as opposed to standing mixers. 

These small handheld mixers offer you unrivaled control and incredible ease of operation. They particularly come in handy when you are making meals for a few people.

### **How to Use the Best Hand Mixers**

Hand mixers are primarily developed to help you [achieve uniformity of ingredients](https://www.wikihow.com/Use-a-Hand-Mixer) for the best cooking results. Before we delve into the nitty-gritty of using your best hand mixers, you should be keen to ensure that you undertake the following precautions:

-   Never let the cod, or the body of your hand mixer come into contact with water
-   Read and follow the manufacturer’s user guidelines as detailed in the user manual
-   Never allow your children to play around with the mixer; it could injure them
-   Avoid moving the parts constantly
-   Always unplug your best hand mixer when not in use

When using your best hand mixer, we advise that you use a deep bowl to prevent spillage of your ingredients. Additionally, you can place the bowl on a rubber liner or surround it with a wet cloth to boost stability. 

Once your working space is set, you should add your ingredients into the bowl and start the hand mixer. You should always start on low speed and increase the blade rotations/speed gradually as you continually add your ingredients. 

Ensure that you entirely cover the bowl’s circumference even as you continue adding more ingredients. Using a rubber spatula, you can scrap the bowl’s sides to return sticky ingredients into the bowl for perfect mixing. 

### How to Clean Your Best Hand Mixer

Once you’re through with your mixing, you should clean your hand mixer immediately to enhance its durability. Here are the steps that you should follow when cleaning:

-   Always ensure that the speed is at zero to protect yourself from cuts
-   Turn it off and unplug
-   Immediately after unplugging, you should eject all the attachments
-   Clean all the attachments/ accessories using warm water and soap
-   Soak a clean cloth on warm and soapy water then use it to gently wipe the hand mixer’s body
-   Dry it using a clean cotton material or let it dry. Once dry, you should store it in your cabinet (ensure that it will not get dusty since this may affect its functionality and reduce its longevity)

### Factors to Consider When Buying the Best Hand Mixers

**1\. Weight**

While hand mixers are convenient kitchen appliances, they can cause arm pains and fatigue if they are too heavy!

Always remember that you’ll be required to hold the mixer throughout your ingredient mixing escapades. As such, you should ensure that you choose a lightweight appliance that will offer all the comfort you need. 

However, when the mixer is too light, you’ll have control problems! Therefore, you should choose a moderate hand mixer that is neither too heavy nor too light. 

***Recommended weight (500 grams to 800 grams).***

**2\. Wattage**

How powerful do you need your hand mixer to be? Well, the amount of power you need will all depend on your needs. As such, you should not spend a fortune trying to buy the most powerful hand mixer yet all you need is to mix a few ingredients when making a cake – occasionally.

Also, it’s crucial to note that some manufacturers have modified their hand mixers to perform optimally when using the least possible power. 

Therefore, it is not always true that the higher the wattage, the more powerful the hand mixer will be. 

The best wattage for a hand mixer is approximately 300 to 400 watts.

**3\. Speed**

If you want the best hand mixer, you should choose one with different speed settings. This will enable you to switch mixing speeds amid your mixing escapades. 

Most hand mixers offer a range of speed settings that can range from 0-12 (With 1 being the slowest and 12 being the highest). The settings allow you to start slowly and increase the speed as you add the ingredients. 

**4\. Attachments Included** 

Having attachments will simplify your mixing exercises and enable you to undertake activities that would otherwise require a stand mixer or a food processor.

[Read more about how a food processor can improve your cooking experiences here](https://thekitchenpot.com/blog/best-food-processor-under-100//)

As such, ensuring that your best hand mixer has attachments will improve your mixing experience significantly. Some of the attachments/accessories you should consider include:

-   Balloon Whisk
-   French Whisk
-   Dough Hook
-   Mixing Bowl
-   Blender
-   Storage Stand

When using these attachments, you should be careful to read the user’s guide. Also, follow the manufacturer’s guide on attaching and ejecting the accessories to ensure that you remain safe throughout the exercise. 

**5\. Design**

You should ensure that your best hand mixer has the following design features:

-   **An ergonomic handle for ease of handling.** This will ensure that you get the best grip when mixing, thus guaranteeing comfort when using it.
-   **A Stable Base.** If you want convenience when storing your best hand mixer, then you should ensure that it has a relatively thick base to avoid toppling.
-   **Size.** The bigger the hand mixer, the more complicated it will be to handle and store. As such, you should ensure that you get a moderately sized mixer that’s powerful enough to offer the best mixing services. 

**6\. Beaters’ Spinning Direction** 

You could be wondering what the spinning direction of your best hand mixers beaters has to do with quality, right?

Well, the spinning direction will affect the quality of your end product significantly. This is how:

When beating your ingredients, you intend to incorporate air, thus achieving a smooth and uniformly mixed outcome. To achieve this, your beaters work against gravity (from the bottom of your bowl to the top).

As such, your beaters must always mix from the inside out. This will ensure that the ingredients are not forced down, which would otherwise result in less air.

**7\. Ease of Cleaning**

It should be easy for you to clean your hand mixer as well as the attachments. This will give you easy maintenance time.
