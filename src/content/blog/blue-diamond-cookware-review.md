-   **Diamond Infused Ceramic Nonstick Coating**

-   **Oven, Broiler, and Dishwasher Safe**
-   **Durable Glass Lids to Seal In Moisture**

Overall, their diamond-infused coating is the epitome of its efficacy, elegance, and ease-of-use.

## Why Blue Diamond Cookware Sets are Special

Blue Diamond Cookware sets a new nonstick standard – characterized by safety, efficacy, and elegance. 

The signature diamond-infused ceramic coating is five times harder and ten times more lasting than **[traditional nonstick coating pans](https://thekitchenpot.com/blog/best-nonstick-pans-with-buying-guide//)**. The company brings the strength of diamond metal to your kitchen! 

When compared to copper, a diamond will transfer heat approximately four times faster. As such, you will get better results in a shorter time. Additionally, the coating’s hardened nature prevents chipping, thus ensuring that you pass your pans to generations!

Even better, Blue Diamond Cookware Sets are free from lead, PFOA, PFAs, and Cadmium. As such, you can be sure of toxin-free meals every time you’re cooking family meals.

**Blue Diamond cookware is not ideal for induction cooktops. If you only use induction hobs for cooking, you shouldn’t buy them. It won’t work!**

## Blue Diamond Cookware Warranty 

Blue Diamond offers a **90-day money-back guarantee and a limited lifetime warranty on all their cookware**. 

If you’re not satisfied with any Blue Diamond Cookware product, you’ll be at liberty to return it for a replacement or a refund within 90 days from the date of purchase. 

The limited lifetime warranty covers all defects in materials and workmanship that may compromise the safety, functionality, or efficacy of your cookware. It starts 90 days from the date of purchase until the end of your lifetime.

However, the warranty does not cover any damage resulting from careless handling, damage in transit, modifications, or normal wear and tear. The company will use its sole discretion to determine whether to replace or repair any product covered by the warranty. 

## **Blue Diamond Ceramic Cookware Sets Review**s

All Blue Diamond cookware sets are made of heavy-duty materials and coated with a [diamond-infused nonstick coating](https://healthy-cookware.com/diamond-coated-cookware/). The base is carefully crafted to resist warping and wobbling, which guarantees durability and unmatched functionality. 

While Blue Diamond markets its products as Metal utensils safe, **we recommend that you do not use metal-based scrubbers when cleaning them**. The longevity of the cookware sets will significantly be enhanced by using gentle and soft cleaning agents. 

The sets are toxin-free, eliminating any fears of toxins associated with Teflon. They are also free of lead, PFO, PFAs, and Cadmium. 

Additionally, the sets are oven and broiler -safe up to 600 degrees F. You can also use their durable glass lids in an oven up to 425 degrees F. The glass lids are ideal since they enable you to monitor your food’s progress without necessarily opening the pots. 

As such, you’ll be able to seal in moisture and lock nutrients, thus guaranteeing a healthy meal for your family. The set also comes with riveted stainless steel handles for a secure and comfortable grip.
