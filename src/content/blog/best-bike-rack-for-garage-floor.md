Any experienced cyclist will gladly warn you against leaving your bicycle out in the open especially on a busy street. You are bound to lose it. The best option is to store it in your garage or your house in case you don’t have a garage. But the thing with garages, almost every piece of crap is stored in the garage, which could damage your bike. This is why you need the best bike rack for garage floor to prevent damage to your bikes and save on space.

Have you ever experienced the frustration and hassle of trying to access your bike but you have to move toys, storage bins or your car to get to the bike? It’s too much hassle for a day’s work and you are yet to begin your commute. You can sort this out either by rearranging your garage or buying a bike rack for your garage.

Initially, bike racks were built for use by the public but as time went by, manufacturers began building more personalized bike racks for personal storage. Today, bike racks are used to secure bikes to a vehicle when travelling or store bikes in garages or indoor spaces. Manufacturers have come up with different designs to fit classic and modern lifestyles. This means that is a bike rack for everyone even for fat bikes.

## Choosing the best bike rack for garage floor

### Ease of use

When it comes to bikes racks, you don’t want to spend the better part of your evening trying to mount a single bike to a bike rack or stand. It’s easier to lean it on a wall or a car but the reason you want a bike rack is so that you don’t have to lean your bike against walls or cars.

What we would call the best bike rack for garage floor may not be the best for you. Our choices are dependent on our needs and preference. You might want a wall mounted bike rack or ceiling mounted bike rack. Both of these choices require you to drill holes into your wall or ceiling, something not every bike owner is willing to do. The remaining option is to settle for a floor rack, which might have a large footprint but at least you don’t have to drill holes.

The idea is that you buy a bike rack that will require very little time to install. And if you can find one that is fully assembled, the better. You also want a bike rack that won’t risk damaging your bikes or property. There have been instances when bikes have fallen from their bikes racks and not only did they damage the bikes but they also cars or other items that were in the garage.

You don’t want to wake up to such a mess, that’s why you need the best bike rack for your garage floor.

### Materials

Another feature you want to consider is the materials. A sturdy and stable bike rack is made of strong materials and coated with rubber to avoid scuffing or scratching your bike. Also, be wary of bike racks with many hooks especially if they are not coated.  Such hooks could easily damage your bike.

You want a bike rack that is strong enough to hold your bike and stable enough not to tip over. Sturdy materials and excellent design are responsible for stability. Therefore, always be wary of the materials used and the kind of design.

### Weight

Although it’s often overlooked, weight is one of the most important features. The weight factor is considered on two fronts, the weight of the bike rack and the weight that it can support.

If you intend to carry your bike rack on your outdoor adventure it’s only logical that it should be light and small enough to fit in your backpack. This is where the concept of foldable bike racks comes into play. Most foldable bike racks can fold down to a size small enough to fit in your backpack. They are also not too heavy, which means you can carry them while riding without noticing the extra weight.

You also ought to consider the weight capacity of the bike rack. Most bike racks can only support a specific weight anything extra will likely result to the bike rack tipping over. With this in mind, be sure to compare the weight rating of the bike rack to the weight of your bike.

### Value

When it comes to bike racks you want to get value for your money. You also don’t want to spend too much on a bike rack as you’ve already invested a lot in your bike. Also, keep in mind that price does not always guarantee quality and functionality.  If you have more than two bikes and kid’s bikes then a 5 bike storage rack would be the best option. But if you only have a single bike then a single bike rack will do.

Ideally, you want a bike rack that is not too expensive but has all the premium features and offer good stability.

## FAQs

### Is a bike rack really necessary?

It depends, do you have enough storage space in your garage to store your bikes and your car? Do you need to transport your bikes when travelling? Do you need to secure your bike while cleaning? There are many reasons why you would need a bike rack but it ultimately comes down to whether you want it or not.

Having a bike rack in your garage makes it easy to arrange and store your bikes. It also eliminates the hassles of wadding through all the junk in your garage just to get your bike. Also, a bike rack will protect your bike from water damage by keeping it off the ground where it’s likely to be exposed to the elements. A bike rack is the recommended bike storage option especially for folks living in cramped apartments.

### What type of bike rack should I buy for my garage?

That depends on the kind of space you have and where you want to mount the bike rack. Do you want to mount the bike rack on the wall, the roof or place it on the floor? Can you manage to lift your bike and place them on a wall mounted bike rack? How many bikes do you have? If you have more than 2 bikes, it’s only logical that you buy a bike rack that can support the weight. Preferably, pick a bike rack that is placed on the floor.

## Are wall mounted and ceiling mounted bike rack considered safe?

If it’s installed correctly you don’t have to worry about safety. Look for a bike rack with strong frames and hooks. Provided you follow the installation instruction, your bikes should hang safely.
