This article offers a comprehensive guide on how to use a double boiler. Read on to get handy tips.

## What is a Double Boiler?

Most people don’t understand the concept of **[double boilers](https://www.amazon.com/Silicone-Spatula-Stainless-Resistant-Chocolate/dp/B07ZVN5HJ6?tag=kitchenpot-20)**. To most, this is the best because it offers two useful kitchen items – a pot and a bowl. 

However, there is a formidable reason why double boilers come as a pair consisting of a pot and a bowl.

If you’ve been keen enough, you’ll notice that the top bowl is designed in a way as to fit into the mouth of the pot. This design is strategic!

It helps to ensure that no steam escapes from the pot. As such, it will heat your food faster and more efficiently.

So, what is a double boiler in one sentence?

> ***A*** ***[double boiler](https://www.amazon.com/Stainless-Double-Resistant-Melting-Chocolate/dp/B08KD77QP7/?tag=kitchenpot-20)*** ***is a set of two pans. One large one that looks like a saucepan and another shallow one fits perfectly on the mouth of the big pot.*** 

Most of the double boilers also come with a lid. However, you’ll seldom need it since most food will require constant stirring. 

If you need to cook meals that require stirring, it would be best to choose a double boiler with a transparent lid. This feature will help you to monitor your food and ensure that it does not burn.

## What is the Use of a Double Boiler?

A double boiler is a kitchen appliance that helps you heat/cook food that does not require high temperatures, such as chocolate and egg yolk.

When using a double boiler, you’ll cook your meals using steam. The section explains how you can use a double boiler to melt chocolate and make other meals. 

## How to Use a Double Boiler

If you’re wondering how to use your recently acquired double boiler, then here is a comprehensive guide:

**Step 1: Clean Your Boilers** 

After **[purchasing your double boiler](https://www.amazon.com/Farberware-Classic-Stainless-2-Quart-Covered/dp/B00004RGB7/?tag=kitchenpot-20)**, you must clean it to get rid of dirt. Ensure that you use warm and soapy water to achieve the best results in seconds!

**Step 2: Fill the Lower Saucepan with Water Quarter Way**

After cleaning the boiler, you should pick the saucepan and fill it with water up to the quarter mark. Do not fill it with water entirely since you’ll not get a space for the bowl.

**Step 3: Place Your Saucepan on Your Cooktop**

Place the saucepan on the **[cooktop](https://thekitchenpot.com/blog/best-induction-cooktop-for-the-money//)** and ignite it. Heat the water for a few minutes.

**Step 4: Place Your Bowl on Top of the Saucepan**

After the water is heated for a while, you should place the bowl on top. Ensure that it covers the mouth entirely to prevent moisture from escaping.

**Step 5: Introduce Your Food Items**

Put your food items (chocolate, egg yolk, or any other item that requires slow cooking) in the bowl. Let steam heat the items slowly.

**Step 6: Stir Regularly Until the Food is Ready**

Once the food starts cooking, you should stir until it is ready. This ensures that it’s evenly done. 

Double boilers are designed to heat the food using steam derived directly from water boiling in the lower saucepan. This prevents direct contact between the food item and the heat source, allowing a slow but even cooking process. As such, you’ll be sure that your food will not scorch. 

***Never overfill the lower pan when using a double boiler. The upper bowl should not come into contact with water, or the entire setup will be null and void!***

You should check the water levels on the lower bowl periodically and fill it up if it runs dry.

If you need to reheat food that does not require further heating, then using a double boiler is an excellent idea. The slow heating will reheat the food without altering the level of their doneness. 

Besides cooking edible food, double boilers are critical in soap making. They are used to melt the wax and mix it with other essential oils. As such, you can be sure that owning a double boiler will be helpful beyond making your meals.
