You can ride a bike in any shoe, but if you want to raise your level qualitatively, the first thing to do is buy Specialized Sport MTB Shoes.

 These shoes have at least one important advantage - circular pedaling. You can not only push down on the pedal but also pull it up from below.

 The muscles' load is evenly distributed, the knees do not suffer, and the power increases. 

Cycling shoes keep your foot tight. This improves the control of the bike, makes it easier to pass obstacles and pedaling uphill.

So ordinary shoes or sneakers are not enough for you to pedal. After hearing about the effectiveness and benefits of mountain biking shoes, you may be thinking about buying them. 

However, the choice of cycling shoes, especially if this is done for the first time, in practice is not an easy task.

This article will help you to know how to [choose Specialized Sport MTB Shoes](https://www.rei.com/learn/expert-advice/cycling-shoes.html) for you. We have also selected 5 best models to narrow down your search.

## How to choose Specialized Sport MTB Shoes Online?

High quality and properly selected cycling shoes will serve you for years, so choose them by following these tips:

Material

The more expensive MTB Shoes are lighter and tougher. The rigidity of the inner lining changes depending on the level of the shoes. 

The higher the level of the shoe, the less padding is inside. 

Top cyclists use shoes that have almost no padding, but they fit perfectly on foot. The principle is simple: the less soft padding, the lighter the shoes and the better the pedal contact.

Cycling shoe color

The color of cycling shoes only affects aesthetic perception. In whites, of course, it will not be so hot in summer, and in black ones, less pollution is visible, but in this matter, the buyer is free to decide for himself/herself. 

Pedaling efficiency will not be affected if the shoes are not black but orange.

### Clasp type

The [type of closure on MTB Shoes](https://www.bikinguniverse.com/shoes-to-wear-mountain-biking/) is usually independent of the type of riding. Choose from personal preference.

- **Laces are a classic.** They do not weigh down the shoes and easily adapt to any shape of the foot. However, you cannot adjust them on the fly.

 

- **Velcro is an easy to use option**. Easy to zip and unfasten, adjust on the go, but tricky to fit exactly in the foot.

 

- **The ratchet clasp is a tight buckle and strap clasp**. It locks the foot tightly, and you can easily adjust them with one hand.

 

- **BOA clasp with a line or steel cable.** It is a reliable system that firmly fixes the foot and is easily adjusted with one hand. Mounted on high-end professional cycling shoes.

### Choose the right size

Do not select cycling shoes that are the same size as your regular casual shoes. See the manufacturer's dimensional chart and recommendations for selection. 

Depending on the manufacturer, American or European sizes are indicated.  If you plan to ride in the cool season, choose a size with a margin, but the foot should be tightly fixed.
