## Lodge Cast Iron Manufacturer

Lodge cast iron skillet is, without a doubt, the most popular skillet in the United States. The skillet is manufactured by [Lodge Manufacturing Company.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lodge_(company))

## What is Cast Iron?

When you think about cast iron, you should think of a furnace-melted iron that contains several other elements such as carbon, silicon, sulfur, and manganese. 

It is formed by smelting iron ore and mixing it with scrap metals and other alloys. The molten mixture is poured into molds and allowed to solidify into the cast iron skillets and pans. 

This treatment makes the **cast iron non-malleable, hard, and brittle.** These critical features guarantee top-notch functionality durability of your cast iron skillet.

## How to Season Cast Iron Skillet

If you look at the adverts, you're likely to be misled that the Lodge cast iron skillet does not require seasoning!

Well, I found this to be untrue.

Initially, it **would be best if you [seasoned your cast iron skillet](https://www.wikihow.com/Season-Cast-Iron-Cookware)** to prevent food from sticking on the pan's surface. 

To achieve this, you should place the pan on the stovetop and let it heat before adding oil (vegetable oil such as canola is best).

Let the oil heat for some time until you can see some smoke coming out of the pan. Remove the pan from the stovetop and let it cool.
