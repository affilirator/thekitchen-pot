I know reading about mountain bike gloves is well, a bit dry.  [Carbon fiber frames](https://mtbnz.com/carbon-bike-fork-buyers-guide-reviews/) are just sexy.  Technical clothing and thermal gear, with hidden pockets and iPhone headphone feed-throughs are nice surprises.  Lithium ion rechargable [mountain bike headlights](https://mtbnz.com/best-mountain-biking-lights/) with retina searing luminosity is just, well, safe.

_I mean, who doesn't want twilled, fleecy thermal garments...the cycling equivalent of warm, comfy pajamas for cold weather rides._

\[toc\]

But MTB gloves are just a low level accessory.  They're the Delta Minuses of the Aldous Huxley line of cycling apparel.  But they serve their place, and the best MTB gloves are simply "there".  They should function without notice.  They provide grip, protection, warmth and help prevent numbness.  And in this sense, [Pearl Izumi gloves](https://amzn.to/37jnYxN) excel.

\[wpsm\_box type="info" float="none" text\_align="left"\] When mountain biking, you have to ride through technical trails, fall a couple of times, collide with twigs and face harsh conditions. This is a clear indication that you need the Best MTB gloves to improve your grip on the handlebars, protect your hands from bruises, provide warmth & comfort, and protect your hands from being grazed. \[/wpsm\_box\]

## Best Winter MTB gloves

Mountain biking during the winter season has always been fun. It is advisable to have winter specific gloves to help you ride comfortably and keep your hands warm.

Luckily, we have compiled a few gloves that can provide the comfort and protection you’ve always wanted during winter.

### 1\. Pearl Izumi Divide Glove

I'm a big fan of Pearl Izumi's Clarino Synthetic leather used on the palm of some of their gloves, including the [P.R.O. Aero gloves](https://amzn.to/2sN28DH).  Not only does it last, but it provides excellent grip wet of dry.  So, when I was looking for a more rugged, utilitarian glove, I decided to purchase the [Pearl Izumi Divide Glove](https://amzn.to/2sLNsok).  Size extra large. They come in three colors, solid black, black with white accents, or red/black with white accents.  

\[content-egg module=Amazon template=custom/compact\_extra next=1\]

Marketed as trail or mountain biking gloves, they're a bit thicker and stiffer than I'm used to.  Stitching is doubled on the transition between thin and thicker fabrics, so longevity should be there.  

Inside the seams are decently maintained, but I've seen better on the P.R.O. gloves where their is never a loose thread.  A solid piece of white piping rims the bottom, along with a rubbered back to the velcro closure.  The red, mesh fabric provides plenty of stretch, but the white detailing on the mesh fabric is actual a siliconized paint.

And while the uppers are a bit industrial in appearance, the palms are what make the gloves.  Again, double stitching is employed on all the seams, and that siliconized white paint appears on the index and middle fingers, securing grip in wet conditions.  

The palm leather lay-up is designed such that the gloves don't bunch together when the thumb is pulled tight, allowing the material to essentially fold in the center.  However, those with tender median nerves in the palm of their hands should look for a different glove (such as the P.R.O. Pittards Gel Glove or the Elite Gel Vent Glove with P.I.'s Comfort Bridge) as these will likely put undue pressure on the nerve.

Buy one size up with respect to your normal glove size.  The gloves are a bit more firm than most and Pearl Izumi tends to run a tad small in sizes.  I've experiences this in their running shoes, [cycling shorts](https://mtbnz.com/best-mountain-bike-shorts/), and now in two pairs of their gloves.  While my hands still fit their gloves (I usually wear an extra large), they are a bit smaller than other brands.

## Best Mountain Bike Gloves for Summer

Riding your bike during summer requires you to have lightweight and comfortable gloves. Good news is that the short finger gloves are designed to serve you during summer and hot weather. Below is our compilation of the best MTB gloves for summer.

 

### 7\. [Inbike 5mm cycling gloves](https://www.amazon.com/INBIKE-Cycling-Mountain-Shock-Absorbing-Breathable/dp/B0748D129N?tag=furiousbikes-20)

[![mountain bike glove reviews](//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B00TB3VTSY&Format=_SL250_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=furiousbikes-20)](https://www.amazon.com/Inbike-Finger-Bicycle-Cycling-Gloves/dp/B00TB3VTSY/ref=as_li_ss_il?ie=UTF8&qid=1497698238&sr=8-1&keywords=Inbike+5mm+Gel+Pad+Cycling+Gloves&linkCode=li3&tag=furiousbikes-20&linkId=6306ff531f4ebaad97b6b8e3e8e1b9f7)

These short finger cycling gloves are one of the best sellers in the market. Most people love them because they have plenty of padding around the palm section. They are made in a way that makes you feel comfortable even during long rides.

According to the manufacturer, the Inbike gloves feature a Velcro closure around the wrist part. This feature ensures that your gloves remain in place when mountain biking. In addition, you’ll note that the el padding extends all the way to the palm area.

The manufacturer has also added a toweling cloth around the thumb area. This cloth comes in handy when wiping sweat on your face. The reason I prefer these gloves is because they are made using knitted mesh fabric and high elastic lycra that allows for flexibility.

The only problem I noted about the Inbikes was the strange sizing; you need to be careful when ordering them, otherwise you might end up with small or oversize gloves.

The Zokki fingerless gloves are designed to last you for years without getting worn out. The best thing about the Zokki’s is that they have a special thick padding around the palm.

The gloves feature Silica gel pad that functions as a buffer layer around the palm. This feature is very essential when it comes to easing palm fatigue and reducing the chances of skipping when riding.

## CHOOSING THE BEST MOUNTAIN BIKE GLOVES

Our goal at Furious bikes is to ensure that you ace your gear shopping skills. We’ll take you through on the factors you should consider when buying the best MTB gloves. After reading our guide, you’ll be in a better position to choose the most ideal gloves for mountain biking.

### _**What are the most crucial features of mountain biking gloves?**_

- Protection
- Padding
- Toweling
- Ventilation
- Cuff length
- Silicone Fingertips
- Touch Screen compatible

### Choose MTB gloves with the right fit

The fit of your gloves as the most crucial factor you should think about. It does not make sense buying loosely fitting gloves just because of their look. The good thing is that you’ll have the chance to try the gloves before you buy. I believe by now you know the size of your gloves; if you still don’t know, it’s the right time you do. This will make it easy to shop online for the best biker gloves.

### Short Finger or Full-fingered MTB Gloves?

Most people tend to think that short-fingered gloves are just for road bikers. The truth is even mountain bikers can use fingerless gloves depending on the weather.

For instance, cyclists who ride in hot areas prefer fingerless gloves over the full-fingered ones. One of the advantages of using fingerless gloves is that you can still use your touchscreen phone and have good contact with the brake levers.

![best mountain bike gloves](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTevwdw3bFs167QLWxebWgDb-3y7xjAZ0G6m_4l5Dl-4zhimDmuiQ)

On the other hand, full-fingered gloves are considered best for cyclists who ride in cold and wet climates. You only have to choose waterproof cycling gloves so that your hands remain dry. Technical trails and riding on rough terrain will require you to purchase the full-fingered option for extra grip & protection.

![ full-fingered mountain biking gloves](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQCsXfSPoDqqqn7YTMIyS3E05aqU8-JaWLw8lsZZWLkOKYYuzi96Q)

### Check for grip & protection aspects

It is important to choose gloves that will offer maximum protection. By recognizing the features that offer great protection, you’ll land yourself a good pair of MTB gloves. 

Good gloves are made using tough leather material. In addition, you’ll note that they have thick padding around the knuckles.

With such kind of protection, you are sure that your hands are safe.  Ensure that the gloves are designed to provide [extra grip on your handlebars](https://mtbnz.com/best-mountain-bike-grips/). The higher the grip, the easy it will be when riding through technical trails.

 

### Special Mountain Biking Gloves Features

Your riding experience will be determined by these comfort features. As listed earlier, there are a couple of features that the best mountain bike gloves will have.  These features are not a must have, but if you are looking to the best quality , you must part with some extra bucks.

Padding helps your hands feel comfortable and warm while riding. It also comes in handy when you fall or get hit by a tree branch on your hands. Ergonomic grips provide extra grip between your hands and the handlebar. Gloves with ventilations keep your hands dry even during long rides thus increasing your comfort level.

Nowadays, companies are coming up with high-end gloves that are compatible with touchscreen phones. With high quality touchscreen gloves, you’ll have an easy time responding to texts without having to remove the gloves. These gloves are making use of conductivity to achieve the best results.

Gloves that incorporate a toweling mechanism are awesome because you can use the part to wipe sweat or moisture off your face.

### Design

Of course every mountain biker wants to have cool looking MTB gloves. This means that you have to look for unique and well-designed gloves. Some of the gloves are designed specifically for women (you can note this when it comes to size and color). Women specific gloves have bright girly colors as well as design.

In terms of size, most women’s gloves for mountain biking are small and are usually thin. On the other hand, men’s specific gloves are usually dull and the size is a bit larger than women’s.

### Consider the season

What does the season have to do with cycling gloves? Well, choosing weather-specific gloves is paramount for any mountain biker. During cold & wet weather, you should buy the best winter mountain bike gloves since they are designed to keep you warm and dry.

If you are purchasing gloves during summer, it is important that you choose comfortable short-fingered gloves. At least you won’t have to complain about your hands sweating.
