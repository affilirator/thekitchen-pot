## **How to Choose the Best Sink for Your Kitchen**

When choosing your ideal kitchen sink, there are several factors to take into consideration. Each sink has its features and benefits, so it’s best to understand all of them thoroughly before making a purchase.

### **Consider the Material of the Sink**

One of the most important parts of choosing your kitchen sink is deciding which material you want. Each material will provide specific benefits, but some may work better for your current or future plans than others.

-   **Cast Iron.** Cast-iron sinks are usually quite heavy, but they last a long time and are resistant to water stains.
-   **Stainless Steel.** Stainless steel sinks are durable and easy to clean, but they don’t provide any special features like color or style.
-   **Copper.** Copper sinks are stylish but expensive. They’re resistant to water stains, too, but they need constant upkeep if you want them to keep their luster over time. The thickness of the sink depends on the gauge used (20-gauge up to 14-gauge). The lower the gauge number, the thicker the metal.
-   **Quartz.** Quartz sinks provide a modern look and are scratch-resistant, but they’re also very expensive.
-   **Ceramic.** Ceramic sinks are lightweight and easy to install, but they scratch easily and can be damaged by water stains.

### **Consider the Shape of Your Sink**

Kitchen sink shape is an important factor for several reasons. Look at your countertop and cabinets before picking a model to make sure you like its style and fit with the rest of your kitchen decor.

-   **Rectangular.** Rectangular sinks are the most popular shape because they work well with many countertops. They also provide a large workspace, which is good for washing larger items or doing dishes by hand.
-   **Bowl.** Bowl-shaped sinks are smaller than rectangular models, but they still provide plenty of room to wash dishes and other kitchenware.
-   **Double Bowl.** Double bowl sinks provide two workspaces side by side, which is great for kitchens with multiple users or appliances that use a lot of water at once.

### **Sink Width Considerations**

Kitchen sink width is another important factor to consider before you buy. If your model doesn’t fit into the area between your countertop and cabinet, it won’t work.

Standard sink widths are 30, 32, and 36 inches. While these options provide a good fit for most kitchens, you can also find models with a width of 24 or 38 inches.

### **Sink Depth Considerations**

When choosing the best white undermount kitchen sink for your kitchen remodel, pay attention to the depth of the sink. If you’re planning to install a double-bowl model, for example, you’ll want one with a deeper depth so it can accommodate both bowls.

-   8-10″ deep sinks provide plenty of room and are great for most kitchens. Unfortunately, most cabinets aren’t wide enough to fit them, so check your measurements before you buy.
-   7″ deep models may provide less room, but they can fit under most cabinets.
-   Less than 6″ deep sinks are the least common options because they don’t provide as much depth as standard models. However, you can also find some that measure up to 12″.

### **Consider the Color of Your Kitchen Sink**

The final factor to consider when choosing an under-mount kitchen sink is color. While most models are simple and come in standard stainless steel, you can find some with special features like an enamel coating for easier cleaning or colanders on each side of the bowl for extra convenience.

White sinks are among the most popular options because they’re simple but still stylish. Sinks with black exteriors are also common because they’re sleek and understated, but white interiors make them slightly more practical for washing dishes.

Quartz sinks provide an upscale look that can work in any kitchen, while copper sinks will give your design a rustic charm it would otherwise lack.

White sinks are perfect for traditional kitchens, but color options like granite and marble come in handy if you’re looking to create a modern style.

### **Consider the Sink Noise Levels**

Kitchen sink noise is another important factor to consider before you buy. If you’re worried about waking up your family or roommates with a loud bang as soon as the sink fills up, you’ll want to find a quiet one.

While noise isn’t usually an issue with ceramic and enamel models, it may be a problem for stainless steel, nickel, and copper sinks because they tend to be noisier when filled with water.

If you must buy stainless steel, ensure that you choose the **[best gauge for kitchen sinks (primarily between 18-gauge, 16-gauge, and 14-gauge)](https://thekitchenpot.com/blog/what-gauge-stainless-steel-sink-is-best//)**. Here is a comprehensive guide on the same. The thicker the stainless steel, the less noisy the sink.

## **Comparison of the Best Kitchen Sinks in the Market**

At this stage, you have all the information you need to find the best white undermount kitchen sink. Now it’s time to learn about other factors that will influence your choice. To help you out, we offer a side-side comparison of the most confusing shopping factors:

### **Topmount Sinks vs. Undermount Sinks**

One of the main differences between top-mount and undermount kitchen sinks is how they attach to your countertop. While both can be installed either inside or outside of the cabinet, there’s a difference in appearance when mounted underneath the shelf.

Undermount models sit flush with the bottom of your countertop and cabinet, which gives them a sleek look but may cause problems if you need to replace the countertop or move the sink in the future.

Topmount sinks, on the other hand, sit above your countertop and cabinet. If you choose this option, make sure you have enough spacing between them, eliminating any chance of leaking.

### **Single Bowl vs. Double Bowl Sinks vs. Triple Bowl Sinks**

When you step out to buy your favorite sink, you’ll notice that you have a choice between single and double bowls. This is a critical factor to consider, especially if you know how many people will be using the sink.

Double-bowl models can help make kitchen clean-up easier because they provide more space for washing dishes, but single-bowl sinks are usually better for rinsing food than for doing the dirty work of cleaning dishes.

Additionally, you should consider the size of your countertop. Double sinks and triple sinks require more space and are not ideal for small kitchens. If space is not a problem, you can choose either option without worrying about how it affects your kitchen design.

### **Undermount Sinks vs. Drop-In Sinks** 

The primary difference between the undermount sinks and drop-in sinks is the position of the lip. In under-mount versions, the lip is below the countertop while the drop-in sinks have the lip parallel to the countertop’s surface.

If you’re looking for speed and convenience, drop-in sinks are your top choice because they can be installed without any cutting or measuring, but undermount models have a slim, sleek appearance that makes them more attractive.

Undermount sinks require more effort during installation because of their size, but they offer more space under the countertop, so you can easily wash large pots and pans.
