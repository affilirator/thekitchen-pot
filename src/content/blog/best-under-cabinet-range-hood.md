## **What to Consider When Choosing the Best Under Cabinet Range Hood**

Every homeowner will have different needs when it comes to their kitchens. However, there are universal factors that you should consider when choosing the [best under cabinet range](https://www.wikihow.com/Install-a-Range-Hood) hood:

***Cost***

How much do you want to spend on the under cabinet range hood? The cost can vary, with the lowest being approximately $100. However, you should never forget that you’ll incur installation costs too! 

The larger the under cabinet range hood, the higher the cost. However, you should be biased towards efficacy rather than the cost. Ensure that you buy the best under cabinet range hood to suit your kitchen size and effectively eliminate all the smoke and dust.

***The Type of the Exhaust System*** 

There are two common exhaust systems: the ducted and the duct-less systems. With the ducted, the under cabinet range hood will collect the contaminated air and channel it out of your home. 

On the contrary, the duct-less system collects the contaminated air, filter it, and re-circulate it into your home. While both of them are effective, it’s important to note the difference before purchase. 

However, the duct-less system may overall be less efficient compared to the ducted one. Also, it may be pretty expensive in repair and maintenance.

***Size***

The size of your under cabinet range hood is another crucial factor to consider. You should review the surface area of your cooktop. If you have a big cooktop, choose a big under cabinet range hood to ensure that all the smoke is captured and removed from your cooking space. 

While larger under cabinet range hood may be expensive, it’ll be worth it, especially if you’re investing in a large cooktop. There is no point in buying a smaller one and compromising the efficacy in the process!

***Installation Process***

When buying your best under cabinet range hood, you should always consider the installation cost. Only purchase that which you’ll afford to install and maintain.

***Power***

The recommended power an under cabinet range hood is a minimum of 100 CFM per linear foot (for under cabinet range hood installed next to a wall) or 150 CFM per linear foot for an island under cabinet range hood.

The more powerful an under cabinet range hood, the more efficient it’ll be. As such, you should always check the manufacturer’s metrics before purchasing one. 

***Aesthetics***

Every homeowner would want to achieve the best look for their kitchen. As such, choose an under cabinet range hood that suits the design and color of your kitchen.

***Level of Noise***

While most under cabinet range hood will be noisy, you should ensure that you choose an effective yet less noisy under cabinet range hood.

***The adjustability of Fan Speed***

Are you able to change the settings of your under cabinet range hood? If you want to achieve efficacy, you must consider this factor!

Under cabinet range hoods with adjustable fan speeds allow you to either increase (when undertaking heavy-duty cooking) or reduce when you want to manage the noise. 

## **Bottom Line: The Best Under Cabinet Range Hood**

Buying your best under cabinet range hood is definitely a plus. It’ll not only add to the cooking convenience but also enhance your kitchen aesthetics. However, the buying process can be pretty complicated especially if you’ve had zero previous experience.
