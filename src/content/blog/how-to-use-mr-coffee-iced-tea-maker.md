But what exactly is the difference between an electric and manual iced tea maker? Well, the electric one is largely automated, making it easy to use. On the contrary, the manual one requires more technical knowhow and patience to achieve that iced tea beverage.

If you’re looking at portability and size, then most electric machines are bulkier than the manual ones.

## **How to Make Iced Tea in a Mr. Coffee Iced Tea Maker**

To [make](https://www.wikihow.com/Use-the-Breville-One-Touch-Tea-Maker) the best cup of iced tea, you’ll need to follow the following easy steps:

-   **Step 1: Water Measurement**

You’ll be required to fill the pitcher with an adequate amount of water (to make enough tea). Mr. Coffee Iced Tea Maker is calibrated well to ensure that you choose 1,2, or 3 quarts. This ensures that you only make enough tea without causing unnecessary spillage. 

-   **Step 2: Pour Water into the Reservoir**  

After measuring the water you need, you should lift the lid of your tea maker and remove the tea basket. Pour your water into the reservoir (the reservoir is at the base).

***You should never fill water past the 3-quart mark since it will lead to spillage!***

-   **Step 3: Put Your Tea Leaves/ Tea Bags** 

Return the tea basket back to position and place your tea. Wondering how many tea bags for Mr. Coffee iced tea maker? Well, around 3-4 tea bags will be ideal. You can also use loose tea to suit your desires and preferences. 

-   **Step 4: Close the Lid and Choose Your Ideal Tea Strength**

Mr. Coffee Iced Tea Maker allows you to choose whether you want mild or strong tea by a simple touch of a button. 

-   **Step 5: Fill Your Pitcher with Ice** 

Get your ice from your **[best ice maker](https://thekitchenpot.com/blog/best-ice-maker-for-home-use//)** and fill the pitcher to your desired level. The pitcher is marked (1-3 quart). If you’re making 3 quarts of iced tea, you should fill your pitcher to the 3-quart mark. Ensure that you position the pitcher beneath the discharge hole to collect your tea. 

-   **Step 5: Plug-In the Tea Maker and Start Brewing**

Once you plug in your tea maker, you should ensure that you press the start button. An orange light will appear, indicating that the brewing has started. Wait until the brewing is complete and it will auto-shut.

-   **Step 6: Iced Tea is Ready!**

When the tea maker stops, it means that the brewing process is complete. Take your iced tea and enjoy it! If you want it to cool further (unnecessary in most cases), you can place it in your refrigerator. 

## **How to Make Infused Iced Tea – With a Fruit** 

If you want your iced tea drink flavored and sweetened, then you’ll achieve that in a rather straightforward way.

All you need to do is add the fruit of your choice to the iced tea immediately after brewing. This is the most natural and healthier way of spicing up your tea. 

Other techniques that you can use to make your chilled tea better include:

-   **Add Extracts.** You can include extracts from various herbs such as vanilla, maple, almond, and rosemary. Luckily, there are tea bags that come with these flavors, thus simplifying the work for you. Other spices to consider include cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves. This will depend on personal preference. 
-   **Add Honey.** If you want sweetened tea, you can either make sugar syrup or add honey. We recommend the use of natural honey. You can also combine it with herbs such as Stevia, ginger, dandelions, and honeysuckle to make it more irresistible. 
-   **Use Green Tea.** It is not mandatory that you use black tea! Instead, you can go for green tea which is healthier. 

When you hit the market, you’ll realize that there are many tea options to choose from. It all boils down to your taste and preferences. 

## **What are the Benefits of Iced Tea over Regular Tea?**
