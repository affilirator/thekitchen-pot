Do you love a touch of sophistication on your cookware? If yes, then you will love the All-Clad D3 cookware set. 

[All-Clad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-Clad) D3 pots and pans are constructed using two different materials: aluminum and stainless steel.

Aluminum brings in its superb heat conductivity while stainless steel brings in its non-reactivity and induction-compatibility features, a combo for great cookware.

Additionally, All-Clad pots are designed uniquely with a shiny and stylish finish. The highly durable stainless steel handles and rivets ensure that you get unmatched support when cooking. 

While these pans are great, they have their shortcomings too. We tested several All-Clad pans and here’s an honest report of our likes and dislikes.

## All-Clad D3 Cookware Set Construction 

![All-Clad D3 Construction ](images/portablegasgrill.jpg)

All-Clad D3 is a construction that features 3 layers. The inner layer is made of 18/10 stainless steel material that ensures even distribution of heat, thus eliminating hot spots.

On the outer layer, the cookware comes with magnetic stainless steel that is optimized to work well with induction hobs and other types of stovetops.

The middle layer consists of sturdy aluminum that guarantees rapid heat up of your pans, thus ensuring that you get the best searing and sautéing results.

If you feel that you barely need some of the **[pieces in the set](https://www.amazon.com/All-Clad-Stainless-Dishwasher-Cookware-10-Piece/dp/B008PLB15Y?tag=kitchenpot-20)**, then we’d recommend that you individually buy the All-Clad cookware pieces that you will use regularly. Here are some of the All-Clad pans and pots that you can buy individually:

### **1\. All-Clad D3 12-Inch Fry Pan/ All-Clad D3 12-Inch Skillet**

Owning a saucepan is a definite need if you cook regularly. It is one of the most versatile cookware you’ll ever have in your kitchen. While these pans are ideal for cooking liquid meals such as soup and broth, you can also use them to braise, deep fry, make pasta, and boil grains.

## Pros and Cons of All-Clad D3 Cookware Set

All-Clad is a king in the Made in USA cookware industry. While other foreign brands such as **[Le Creuset](https://thekitchenpot.com/blog/le-creuset-cast-iron-skillet//)**, **[Milo](https://thekitchenpot.com/blog/milo-dutch-oven-review//)**, and Staub are increasingly upping their quality, All-Clad’s technology remains unique in the industry.

The use of layered structures with different metals all around their pans and pots are quite outstanding. The technology not only makes their pans unique but also guarantees longevity and top-notch functionality. 

However, All-Clad pots and pans also have a few drawbacks that you should consider before settling for your ideal cookware. The cons include:

-   **They are Expensive.** This is the most pronounced disadvantage of All-Clad cookware. If you need them, then you must be ready to part with a sum way higher than your average cookware in the market. For example, its D3 cookware set can set you back over $500 while there are sets that cost way below $200. However, the price is commensurate with the quality. If you love investing in an item once for a lifetime, then spend the dollars and get this lifetime cookware. 
-   **They Can Scratch Easily.** When you buy All-Clad cookware, you should be careful to use non-abrasive cleaning agents. Otherwise, the elegant surface may get a few scratches. The beauty about it, however, is the fact that these scratches do not affect the cookware’s performance whatsoever. 
-   **They Lack Pouring Lip.** A pouring spout is essential since it helps you to transfer liquid meals without spillage. The lack of the lip may cause messy cooking, which is not desirable for many cooks. 

Additionally, the All-Clad D3 pans and pots are not entirely non-stick. You will require a thin layer of butter or oil to prevent the food from sticking on its surfaces. However, even without oil, the pans have a certain degree of non-stick properties and the food doesn’t stick much. Luckily, All-Clad Nonstick Pans will do you good if you love nonstick cookware.

### **Pros of All-Clad D3 Cookware Set**

Now that we’ve looked at what’s not so appealing about the All-Clad cookware, let’s delve into the reasons why the cookware is worth your attention.

The All-Clad D3 line is constructed using three metal layers, which guarantees uniform heat distribution, relatively good heat retention, and superb heat responsiveness. 

Besides, All-Clad’s unique construction ensures that you enjoy the following other benefits:

**Durability** 

Buying All-Clad D3 cookware is not a gamble. This cookware is designed to serve you for a lifetime – and it comes with a limited lifetime warranty as a guarantee of this feature. To be honest, I doubt whether you’ll ever need the warranty! 

The cookware is durable, and I own a frying pan that I inherited from my parents – by estimation, this fry pan is more than 15 years old and it functions just as it was new!

What I particularly love about All-Clad cookware is the durability of its handles. Unlike other pans whose rivets and screws loosen with time, the All-Clad feels firm even after many years of use. 

All the parts of the pans are metallic and designed to withstand harsh environments and external pressures. Banging these pans will not bend or warp them! Yes, they are that strong.

**Oven-Safe**

You can use the All-Clad pans in an oven without any fear. Its versatility makes them ideal for baking, searing, sautéing, browning, braising, boiling among other kitchen uses. 

The **[All-Clad Dutch oven](https://www.amazon.com/All-Clad-Copper-Dishwasher-Cookware-5-5-Quart/dp/B00005AL1N?tag=kitchenpot-20)** is even effective in baking bread! Yes, you will easily bake your favorite cakes, roast a chicken, or roast a brisket using the cookware. 

**Easy-to-Clean** 

Cleaning All-Clad pans is a breeze. However, we advise that you do not let burnt food stick on the pan for long. This way, you will have an easy time.

If you’re finding it difficult to clean the pans due to debris, you should use baking soda to get rid of them.

**[Read more about how to clean stainless steel cookware here](https://thekitchenpot.com/blog/how-to-clean-stainless-steel-pans//)**

Additionally, we recommend that you use non-abrasive cleaning agents to prevent scratches that would make the pan a bit ugly. Also, avoid using a dishwasher. 

**Stylish Construction** 

Most of All-Clad’s pans and pots are highly aesthetic. They are pans that you will take to the dining table without an iota of shame. Yes, they are ripe for a showoff!

They come with an extremely attractive shiny finish and highly ergonomic handles that add to their elegance. 

**Stay Cool Handles**

All-Clad D3 pans and pots have stainless steel handles that are designed to stay cool even when cooking on a stovetop. 

As such, you can be sure that you’ll prepare your meals hassle-free with no worry of burning your hands. 

## All-Clad D3 Cookware Set Review – Is it Worth Your Money?

All-Clad D3 pans and pots are heavy and worth every penny you spend on them. When using them, you’ll be guaranteed top-notch functionality and ease of cleaning. 

However, the cookware is not entirely nonstick. As such, you will need to apply a little butter or oil to get the best results. 

Overall, this cookware scores excellently on performance and durability. On cleaning, I would only score it as average since it may develop scratches, especially when you use abrasive cleaning agents. If you experience cleaning difficulties, you should always consider using baking soda.
