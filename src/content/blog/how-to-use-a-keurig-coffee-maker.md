## What is a Keurig Coffee Maker?

Before we proceed, it would best if you understand what Keurig means. Well, [Keurig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keurig) is a beverage brewing system for home or commercial use. 

The machines are named after the founder, Keurig Dr. Pepper. The main products from Keurig include single-serve coffee machines, commercial multiple-cups machines, K-Cup pods, and many other beverage pods. 

**We compiled a research-based article on Keurig. Could you read it** [**here**](https://thekitchenpot.com/blog/top-5-keurig-coffee-maker//)**?**

The Keurig Machines work well with specially designed coffee pods called the K-cups. Once you become conversant with the Keurig coffee making machine, you’ll realize that it is quite a simple and convenient machine to use. 

## How to Use Keurig Coffee Maker Machine

If you’ve just bought your Keurig machine, you should ensure that it’s well-assembled to ensure no leakage, thus optimizing performance. 

### Assembling Keurig Machine

-   **Remove All Protective Tapes.** Before you start using your machine, you should remove all adhesive tapes. 
-   **Place it on the Grounded Outlet.** Keurig comes with three holes – two to bring in power and one to ground the power in case of surges. 
-   **Rinse your Water Reservoir.** Locate your water reservoir (can be at the side or the back of the machine, depending on your model) and remove it. Lift the lid and clean it with warm, clean water. If your Keurig has a built-in reservoir, you should run water through it and rinse it until clean. 
-   **Test Functionality.** Once you clean the Keurig Machine, you should fill the reservoir with water up to the MAX line, put the lid into place, and press the power button. It should show a power light display. 
-   **Run a Cleansing Brew Cycle.** Before you start using the machine, you should run a brew cycle without using the K-Cup. Place your ordinary mug on the drip tray and open/close the K-Cup holder. Press the size cup (small, medium, large) to start brewing. 

Once you’re through all these processes, you can be sure that your Keurig Coffee Maker is fully functional. Next is the actual brewing process!

## How to Brew Coffee Using a Keurig Coffee Machine

Brewing coffee using a Keurig machine is a straightforward exercise. Follow these practical steps, and you’ll have your cup of coffee fast! 

### **Check that Your Keurig Machine is Plugged In**

Ensure that your machine is plugged into power. Depending on your model, you should see the light indicating that your machine is ready to brew. 

### **Choose Your Pod** 

You should now select the K-Cup that you need to use, depending on the coffee strength you need. There are many pods available in the market, and you should be able to choose one that is compatible with your machine and gives you the desired taste. Keurig machines come with two brewing systems: Keurig 1.0 and Keurig 2.0 

Keurig 1.0 series brew K-Cup pods only while Keurig 2.0 brews K-CUp, K-Vue, K-Carafe, and K-Mug. Unlike the 1.0 series, the 2.0 one can only work with Keurig-licensed pods. 

### **Fill Your Reservoir**

Keurig machines will have a reservoir that can store enough water to brew several cups of coffee. Ensure that you still have water in the reservoir. If not, you should top up the water to the MAX level. The reservoir can either be built-in or removable, depending on the model. 

## Place the Mug on the Drip Tray

Choose a mug that can work well with your Keurig Machine. Ensure that you choose a cup of the best size and shape to get the best results. Place it on the drip tray in preparation for the brewing process. 

### Lift the Handle and Insert the Pod/ K-Cup

Lift the handle to access the K-Cup holder and insert your pod (foil side up). Never remove the foil since the Keurig Machine is specially designed to pierce the foil and release the contents.

### Lower the Handle

Once the K-Cup is in place, you should lower the handle until the lid is completely closed. The machine will indicate that it is ready to brew (different wording depending on the model). 

### Select Your Brewing Settings

Once everything is in place, you should select the settings that may include the brew size, brew temperature, and bold selector.

### Start the Brewing 

Press the BREW button and wait for your coffee. The brewing takes anywhere between 1-5 minutes, depending on your settings and the model. You are likely to hear a loud burst of air to let you know that the brewing is complete (depending on the model)

## How to Clean and Maintain Your Keurig Coffee Maker Machine

[Cleaning](https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/home/cleaning/a35532/how-to-clean-a-keurig-coffee-maker/) and maintaining your coffee maker is essential as it improves efficacy and guarantees longevity. We recommend that you descale your Keurig machine after every 3-6 months, depending on the frequency of use. 

### **Descaling Keurig Coffee Maker Using White Vinegar**

Since Keurig boils water, some mineral deposits such as calcium and iron will be left behind to form compounds that appear as debris/ scales on your Keurig. 

As such, there is an absolute need to descale it regularly to restore its glow and improve its functionality. To achieve that, you should follow these steps:

-   Fill the reservoir halfway with vinegar.
-   Run several brewing cycles without K-Cup. Repeat the process until the reservoir is empty.
-   Repeat the process with plain water to rinse it 

If you want to avoid the scaling and debris build-up, you should avoid using hard tap water. Instead, you can use bottled or distilled water, which is softened and the minerals that result in debris removed.

### Cleaning the Keurig Machine Exterior

If you experience a build-up of dirt and grime at the exterior of the Keurig machine, then you shouldn’t panic. Removing them is a breeze!

All that you’ll need is warm, soapy water and a microfiber cloth. Wipe it gently until it becomes shiny once more. Rinse it with clean water and then dry it. 

Never immerse the Keurig machine into the water entirely since that can damage the electrical components, thus affecting its functionality significantly.

### How to Clean the Keurig Machine Drip Tray 

Whenever the drip tray gets full, you should remove it and drain the fluid. This avoids overflow, which would otherwise complicate your cleaning escapades. 

Once you empty it, you should use warm and soapy water to wipe away the dirt. Rinse it and dry it before returning it to the Keurig machine. 

## How to Clean the K-Cup Holder

When the Keurig machine clog’s internal components, you need to disembark it and clean it thoroughly, thus guaranteeing top-notch performance. 

To clean your K-Cup holder, you should lift the handle and pull up the holder to remove the funnel. Clean it using warm and soapy water. 

Always remember that the **K-Cup holder has sharp needles that can hurt you**! Be careful when handling it. 

## Tip to Reduce Dirt Accumulation on Keurig

Whenever you brew sticky beverages, you should flush the Keurig machine with hot water immediately after you finish. This will prevent sugar crystallization, thus saving you on the cleaning hassle. 

## How to Use a Keurig -The Bottom Line
