## Best Blender for Protein Shake: Buying Guide

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWcIKbWK0Ko

Now that you've decided to buy the best blender for protein shakes, there are some last things to be considered before you make the actual purchase! 

Let's get into these aspects;

#### Wattage

The higher the blender wattage, the faster it will blend your food. If that's what your lifestyle reflects, then consider chipping yourself in for some extra blending speed. Also, check on the power behind the blender.

If you love frozen fruits or ice in your protein shakes, then plan for a powerful blender since a low powered blender can overheat and break the entire workload. 

You can as well target a 300 watts blender if your focus is on shakes mixed with milk and fresh milk. But if you will be adding ice in your shakes, and need it to perform better for all types of blending tasks, then 1,000 watts can serve you better.

#### Durability

Blenders are dishwasher-friendly. But cleaning the blender can be as easy as placing soapy water in the cup then running it for a while.

However, plastic-made appliances are less durable than thick material blenders. Plastics will not retain the temperature for a long time, thus making them less attractive if you want your protein shakes to ice cold.

Generally, when you think of buying a blender that comes with a stainless steel metal blade, then you'll be investing better. These material-made blenders tend to last longer and are useful when it comes to harsh ingredients.

#### Warranty

Every machine comes with the high possibility that it can, at some point, suffer from a breakdown or a malfunction. Since you're making an investment in a device that can have trouble down the road, you will ensure that you're covered.

Taking more time to investigate if there's an honest and sufficient warranty is crucial. Sometimes, although you hope it will never happen, you may fall into a problem or two. In case you fall in such a scenario, you'll want to make sure that you're covered!

#### Size

Bigger size doesn't mean better. If you love protein shakes, then you don't need a jumbo-sized blender. But if you aim to shift the blending game past one-main protein shakes, and move onwards to soups, margaritas, and salsa then consider buying a big sized blenders

Also, when you stay in a single-bedroom apartment, kitchen space can be a big issue. Ensure you think of buying something that will fit in your kitchen correctly.

#### Budget

Definitely! This is an easy question, but it is always ignored by many. If you decide the amount to spend on that dealer shop, you can narrow down to the best brands quickly.

You may wish to settle for the best blender. But when the budget is small, go for a simple and affordable model. But if you have more money, why don't you go for an expensive pick? It won't hurt! Get it for fulfillment.
