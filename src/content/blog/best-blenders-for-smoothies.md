## **6 Best Blenders for Smoothies**

### **1\. [Ninja BL770 Kitchen System](https://www.amazon.com/Ninja-Kitchen-BL770-Processor-Smoothies/dp/B00939I7EK?tag=kitchenpot-20)**

![Best Blender for Smoothies](images/portablegasgrill.jpg)

The ninja BL770 kitchen system comes with a high-powered motor and additional accessories for food processing. The appliance adds exceptional values to your range but still comes at a competitive price.

The ninja BL770 kitchen system is 17 inches tall, 7.5 inches wide, and 9.5 inches deep. That means that the device is large and you’ll need to find an open spot, probably on a kitchen table or island.

The machine has a 1500-watt (2-HP) motor base that powers it. It has 3 speeds, to switch between 1 pulse function and 1 single-serve preset. It will also let you pulse, but at a speed that is appropriate for small jars.

The Ninja BL770 blender also features a pitcher and the bowl which use removable multi-blade hubs to do the blending instead of the conventional blade assembly at the base. This style of the blade works well if the load is large enough, like when you’re mixing for two or three people.

The ninja BL770 kitchen system has accessories which include one 72-ounce (9-cup) pitcher and one 64-ounce (8-cup) food processor bowl with a lid that acts as a safety key. Specifically, the motor will not turn unless the lid is locked on.

There are two small (or single serving) jars that are 16 ounces each. Unlike the pitcher, they have a base-blade assembly that screws on like a lid.

For cleaning, try warm water in the jar/pitcher and blend it with a few drops of dish soap, or your dish- wash your blender. Just remember to soak them well before loading them.
