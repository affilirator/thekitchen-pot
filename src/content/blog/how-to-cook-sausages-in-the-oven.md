## Alternative Methods of Cooking Sausages 

Sausages offer high-level versatility, and there are a plethora of options that you can use to cook them. Besides baking them in the oven, you can also use the following methods to cook your sausages:

**Boiling**

Boiling your sausages is one of the easiest and healthiest methods to prepare your sausages at home. 

To boil your sausages, you should place them into a pot of boiling water and let them simmer for a few minutes.

If they are pre-cooked, your sausages will be ready after 10-15 minutes. If they are raw, you should boil them under low heat for approximately 30 minutes. 

Boiling your sausages will not offer any browning or crispy appearance on the outside. If you need the crispness, we recommend you use a pan-frying method. You can only boil sausage links and not patties. 

**Grilling and Broiling** 

These sausage cooking techniques use high-temperature to achieve an exceptional browning and irresistible crispness. 

The difference between grilling and broiling is primarily on the method of heating used. For grilling, the heat is below the sausages, while broiling involves heating the sausages from above. 

To achieve the unique flavor, ensure that you grill your sausages for approximately 10 minutes while turning them after every few minutes. 

If you use the broiling option, you should place the sausages on a broiler pan and place them in an oven for 10 minutes. Ensure that you turn them halfway to ensure even doneness and well-distributed browning. 

**Stir-Frying/ Pan-Frying**

Stir-frying involves cooking your sausages in a skillet, pan, or a wok. You will be required to flip the sausages regularly to achieve uniform doneness. 

To pan-fry your sausages, you should add a few drops of oil into your pan and let it heat. Add your sausages and turn them regularly until they brown both sides. The entire cooking process may take 10-15 minutes. 

The use of oil makes stir-frying is a relatively unhealthy sausage cooking method. However, you can use healthy/vegetable oil such as canola oil, avocado oil, olive oil, coconut oil, or butter.

Avoid frying your sausages for long since they may form undesirable compounds that may have adverse health effects. After cooking for 15 minutes, you can cut one sausage to check whether the inner is firm, in which case it will be ready. 

**Deep Frying** 

This is the unhealthiest method of cooking your sausages. It involves complete immersion of the sausages in fat. Consequently, the sausages will absorb quite a large amount of oil, which may not be drained entirely even with the use of serviettes. 

To deep-fry your sausage, you should into a deep fryer containing heated oil (of up to 375°F). Cook the sausages until they are done (after approximately 5 minutes).

***To get the best results, use oils with a high smoke point. Viable options include coconut oil, olive oil, and avocado oil***.

Additionally, you can egg wash (eggs and cream/milk) and cover them with breadcrumb to make them even tastier.

While this method is widely used, the final product has higher calories and fat content than all other cooking methods.
