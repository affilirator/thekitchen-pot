## Toyota Camry Bike Rack Buying Guide

In this buyer’s guide, we will go through a list of features to look for when shopping for a bike rack for your Toyota Camry.

As you probably know, there is a wide variety of bike racks and they come in different mounting styles. Some are hitch mounted, others are strap mounted and there are also upright style designs.

Each of these mounting styles is compatible with specific types of vehicles. It’s advisable that you confirm that the bike rack you choose is compatible with the car you’re using.

### Types of Bike Racks

#### 1\. Hitch Mounted Racks

Of the four available styles, hitch mounted racks are the most convenient. Once you’ve installed it on your car, the next step involves lifting your bikes and placing them onto the trays. This is more convenient that lifting your bike and placing them on the roof of the car.

Most hitch racks slide directly into the car’s receiver tube and are available for 2 or 1.25-inch receivers. Newer models are designed to fold up when not in use giving you access to the trunk. They also have integrated locks that secure your bike to the rack and arms that extend over the front wheels of the bike/bikes. The only downside to using these racks is that they extend outwards and if you aren’t careful you could damage your bike when parallel packing or backing up.

Hitch mounted racks are typically more expensive than other racks but the ease of set up, loading, unloading and the fact that you don’t have to lift the bikes over your head, make them a preferred option.

Newer designs have better locking systems that allow for one-handed fitting. While others come with locks that secure the bikes to the rack and then the rack to the car. If you are lucky, you could find a hitch mounted rack with hinged load sections that provide access to the tailgate or boot without having to unstrap the bikes.

### 2\. Roof-Mounted Racks

There are at least 3 types of roof-mounted racks: a complete rack system which is designed to mount on a bare roof, suction cups that attach to any surface by creating vacuum seals and trays that you mount onto the factory-installed tracks/crossbars/side rails.

There are 2 ways to install a bike to a roof-mounted rack: you can either attach it with front wheel or without. Removing the front wheel lightens the bike and also lowers the height. However, this is not always possible with all bike models especially disc brake equipped bikes. The other option is leaving the front wheel on, which eliminates concerns regarding disc brakes but you have to sacrifice a little bit of stability.

Although they are not permanent, roof-mounted racks tend to stay attached to the roof all the time due to their versatility. They’re compatible with most sport-specific accessories which allows you to carry SUP boards, kayaks, cargo boxes, bikes, skies, etc. Basically, you can carry any bulky item with a roof-mounted rack.

### 3\. Trunk-Mounted Racks

Trunk mounted racks are the least secure and least expensive of the four. They consist of straps that secure the bikes around the bumper/trunk/hatchback of your vehicle. Of the four, they are the lightest and most portable.

They take a while to get used to but once you get the hang of it, installing and removing the rack becomes easy. The only downside to having a trunk rack is that it limits access to the trunk.

Trunk racks typically carry 1 or 2 bikes at a time. And since they use nylons straps and cables, they have a weight limit. The use of nylon straps and cables may present a security concern as they can easily be cut. They are recommended for hatchbacks or sedans but be sure to gather feedback from online sources or friends before settling for a trunk rack.

### 4\. Spare-Tire Racks

Most off-road and sports utility vehicles are fitted with rear-mounted spare tires which can be used to secure bike racks. Spare-tire racks are similar to trunk racks in that they both use straps to secure the bikes to the rear of the vehicle.

The upside of using a spare-tire bike rack is that you can still access the rear of your car without removing the bikes. You also don’t have to worry about scratches or dents caused by the bikes when it swings or when you open the rear door.

## Key Features to Consider When Buying a Toyota Camry Bike Rack

The more features you want, the higher the cost of the bike rack. Try to prioritize on security and the method of attachment.

1. ### Locking cables
    

These are security devices that secure your bike by locking it into place. It takes less than 3 minutes for an experienced thief to unsecure your bike from the rack, a situation you can avoid by buying a bike rack with locking cables. This is a standard feature in premium models and for mid-range models there is an option to buy it separately.

2. ### Car Attachment Points
    

Before you can attach your bike to the rack, you need to mount the rack to the car. The method of attaching it to your car will vary depending on the style. You want a rack with padded, tipped or coated attachment points to prevent damage to the paintjob.

3. ### Strong securing points
    

The idea of buying a bike rack is to have a convenient way of securing your bikes to your car when traveling. This means that the securing points have to be strong enough to accommodate the weight of the bikes and still be gentle enough not to cause any damage to the paintwork, wheels or frame. You also want a bike rack that is strong enough to withstand strong winds.

4. ### Number of bikes you intend to carry
    

This should be the first feature you ought to consider when shopping for bike racks. There is no point in buying a bike that can only carry two bikes when you want to carry four bikes.

Always consider the number of bikes that you will to carry at any given time. Use this information as your guide when choosing the best bike rack for Toyota Camry.

5. ### Budget
    

Price is a factor in everything. You simply can’t spend more than you have. Always check the price and compare it with your budget. There are affordable racks with impressive features and are just as good as the premium models. However, if you will be a frequent user of your rack, it’s advisable that you spend a little bit extra to get a bike rack that has better security features.

Don’t let the price dictate what you will buy, sometimes it’s worth waiting in order to accumulate enough money to get the best bike rack.

6. ### Reputation
    

A company’s reputation says a lot about their products and customer service. Preferably, choose a company that has been operating for many years and offers reasonable warranties.

Also, be sure to assess the quality and reputation of the said product. You could try social media where you are likely to get honest responses.
