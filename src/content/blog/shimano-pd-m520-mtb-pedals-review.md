The Shimano PD-M520 MTB pedals are a popular choice among mountain bikers and commuters due to their affordability, reliability, and straightforward adjustment. They offer consistent performance and are hard to distinguish from more expensive Shimano models like the XT and XTR in terms of their mechanism to control entry and release. The pedals are also relatively lightweight at 374g per pair[1](https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/pedals/shimano-pd-m520-pedals-review/).Pros of the Shimano PD-M520 pedals include:

1. **Affordability**: These pedals are priced lower than many other models, making them a cost-effective choice[1](https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/pedals/shimano-pd-m520-pedals-review/)[2](https://www.bikeperfect.com/reviews/shimano-pd-m520-pedal-review-a-dependable-legend).

3. **Reliability**: They are known for their durability and can withstand years of use[2](https://www.bikeperfect.com/reviews/shimano-pd-m520-pedal-review-a-dependable-legend).

5. **Maintenance**: The pedals are easy to service, with most maintenance tasks taking about half an hour for the average rider[1](https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/pedals/shimano-pd-m520-pedals-review/).

7. **Performance**: The pedals offer consistent performance and are comparable to more expensive Shimano models[1](https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/pedals/shimano-pd-m520-pedals-review/)[2](https://www.bikeperfect.com/reviews/shimano-pd-m520-pedal-review-a-dependable-legend).

9. **Double-sided entry**: This feature makes them a favorite among commuters and mountain bikers[1](https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/pedals/shimano-pd-m520-pedals-review/).

However, there are also some cons to consider:

1. **Aesthetics**: The PD-M520 pedals are not particularly attractive[1](https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/pedals/shimano-pd-m520-pedals-review/)[3](https://off.road.cc/content/review/pedals/shimano-pd-m520-spd-pedal-11631).

3. **Lack of cage support**: Those who prefer a cage around their pedals for additional support might be better off looking at other models like the Shimano M530s[1](https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/pedals/shimano-pd-m520-pedals-review/).

5. **Materials**: While the mechanism is similar to higher-end models, the materials used in the PD-M520 are down-specced to meet the price point[1](https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/pedals/shimano-pd-m520-pedals-review/).

Compared to other Shimano pedals, the PD-M520 offers a great balance of price and performance. However, if you're looking for more advanced features, lighter weight, or a more aesthetically pleasing design, you might want to consider other models like the Shimano XT or XTR

## differences between the shimano pd-m520 mtb pedals and the shimano pd-m520 spd pedals

The Shimano PD-M520 MTB pedals and the Shimano PD-M520 SPD pedals are essentially the same product. Both are dual-sided SPD pedals designed for mountain biking, and they offer reliable performance in a serviceable package at an affordable price point[1](https://off.road.cc/content/review/pedals/shimano-pd-m520-spd-pedal-11631).The main difference between the two models is aesthetic. The M520L variant is black, while the standard M520 comes in both black and silver[2](https://weightweenies.starbike.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=90439).Both models are known for their durability, ease of maintenance, and adjustable tension. They are also fully serviceable, meaning that worn-out parts can be replaced, which is both cost-effective and sustainable[1](https://off.road.cc/content/review/pedals/shimano-pd-m520-spd-pedal-11631).The performance of the M520 pedals is comparable to that of more expensive Shimano models, such as the M540, XT, and XTR pedals. However, these higher-end models may offer additional features, such as a lighter weight or a more refined design[1](https://off.road.cc/content/review/pedals/shimano-pd-m520-spd-pedal-11631)[3](https://www.reddit.com/r/MTB/comments/6yo55r/whats_the_difference_between_shimano_m520/).In conclusion, the Shimano PD-M520 MTB pedals and the Shimano PD-M520 SPD pedals are essentially the same product, with the main difference being the color options available. Both models offer reliable performance and great value for money, making them a popular choice among both beginner and advanced riders
