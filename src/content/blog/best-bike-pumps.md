### Mountain Bike Floor Pumps

![best mtb bike pump](images/best-mtb-bike-pump.jpg)

- An MTB floor pump, also known as a track pump, offers you the most efficient and quickest way for pumping air into your tires – it is almost as easy as inflating with an air compressor.
- It does not involve the hassles and the amount of effort that is required with other types of pumps, particularly mini pumps.
- A floor pump is also much more durable than the other types of pumps.

These pumps are typically two to three feet tall and have a generously high-pressure capacity (most floor pumps have a pressure capacity of around 160 PSI).

However, unless you are a professional cyclist, you will never need to fill your bike tires to such high pressures. Due to the larger size of floor pumps, these are often kept at home and are used for pumping up tires _before you begin your ride_ unlike mini pumps or frame pumps.

#### _5 Best Floor Pumps:- Quick Answer_

1. Serfas TCPG Bicycle Floor Pump
2. AerGun X-1000 Bike Floor Pump
3. Vibrelli Bike Floor Pump
4. Schwinn Floor Pump
5. Lezyne Micro Floor Drive Pump

The Schwinn Floor Pump is a simple, easy-to-use, no-nonsense floor pump that is best suited for individuals that are restricted to a limited budget (or need a backup pump).

This product has a durable construction with a metal barrel and a sturdy and wide base for support.

The pump head is compatible with both Presta and Schrader valves though you might need to make a few adjustments with the locking lever.

The Lezyne Micro Floor Pump is a compact and ergonomic MTB bike pump that offers the portability of a mini pump with the comfort and power of a floor pump.

The 24-inch hose makes it easy to reach the bicycle’s tire valve stems from a distance. There is a stainless-steel footbed included in the pump, as well, which allows you to keep it stable and steady while pumping.

## 2\. Best Mini Pumps For Mountain Bikes

![best mountain bike floor pump](images/best-mountain-bike-floor-pump-1024x576.jpg)

A mini bicycle pump is a portable pump that you can easily carry around in your backpack, [hydration pack](https://mtbnz.com/best-hydration-packs-for-mountain-biking/), or on the [frame of your bicycle](https://mtbnz.com/frame-building-appropriate-technology/).

The best mountain bike mini pumps are capable of inflating tires to reasonable pressures and hence, are ideal for emergency situations and accidents such as a mid-ride puncture.

However, due to the increased effort that is involved, mini pumps are _not_ a good choice for inflating your bicycle tires on a daily basis. The best MTB mini pumps are usually compact, lightweight, and feature a plastic or aluminum construction which is not as durable as the metal construction on floor pumps.

#### _The 5 Best Mini Bicycle pumps:- Quick Answer_

1. Vibrelli Mini Bike Pump
2. SKS Spaero Double Action Mini Pump
3. Pro Bike Tool Mini Bicycle Pump
4. Zefal HPX Frame-Fit Pump
5. Pro Bike Tool Mini Floor Bike Pump

The Vibrelli model is one of the best MTB mini pumps that integrates an intelligent design with solid construction to provide a convenient on-the-go experience.

There is an advanced extendable telescope included in the pump that allows you to easily switch between high volume and high pressure, depending on your requirements. The maximum pressure capacity of the pump is 120 PSI.

This mini mountain bicycle pump also incorporates an intuitively designed valve that is compatible with Presta and Schrader valves.

The mounting bracket and the Velcro straps make it easier to carry this mini pump since it can be directly attached to your bicycle (no need for an additional pump bag). The 218-mm length and the 270-gram weight further add to the portability of this pump.

### 2\.

One feature that sets the SKS Spaero Mini Pump apart from all the rest is its modern styling.

We personally think that this is the best design for a mini MTB pump in our review list.

This bike pump sports a T-type handle which makes it easier to apply sufficient pumping force. It is also compatible with Presta and Schrader valves which means that it can be used with mountain and road bikes.

The ‘double action’ feature allows you to pump air not just by pushing but by pulling as well which we find to be very convenient, actually!

There is also a flexible hose attached to this pump which ensures that the pressure remains steady throughout the pumping process. Moving on to dimensions, the pump has a length of 241 mm, a weight of 159 grams, and maximum pressure capacity of 87 PSI.

\[themify\_hr color="light-gray"\]

#### Pros:

- The ‘double action’ feature comes in quite handy during pumping.
- Flexible hose attachment allows for a more comfortable inflating experience.
- It is one of the best mini bicycle pumps since it is compatible with both Presta and Schrader valves.

![](https://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=furiousbikes-20&l=li3&o=1&a=B00OP5KB0K)\[themify\_hr color="light-gray"\]

#### Cons:

- The maximum pressure capacity is low when compared to other mini pumps.
- The handle is a little awkward to use.
- It is quite expensive, especially when compared to other MTB mini pumps.

The Pro Bike Tool Mini Bike Pump is a highly portable, and easy-to-use MTB bike pump that features a lightweight and durable design.

The pump head is compatible with Presta and Schrader valves without the need for additional adapters.

A (clever) oversized piston allows you to pump more air per stroke which means that it requires less effort to inflate a tire with this pump.

While it does not compete to the proficiency of a floor pump, it is capable of inflating a tire of almost any size in less than a minute.

The flexible air hose design allows the pump to work with awkward valve placements as well. A pressure gauge is also integrated into the pump which is surprising for a mini pump but adds to the overall convenience offered by the pump.

The length of the pump is 222 mm, the weight is just 127 grams, and the maximum pressure capacity is 120 PSI (which is practically impossible to reach with a hand pump though).

It has been designed to fit on the frames of most bicycles but it can also stand on its long barrel when needed.

If you are tired of making use of the MTB mini pumps that require a lot of effort then this might be the right choice for you since the longer barrel allows for a more efficient and smooth pumping experience.

This product is only compatible with Presta valves though and requires you to have an adapter for the Schrader valve – keep in mind that this can reduce performance when used with a mountain bike.

This frame pump sports a solid aluminum construction and can pump to an impressive maximum capacity of 174 PSI. It comes in four different sizes that you can choose from, depending on your requirements.

## 3\. Best Bicycle Frame Pump:

A frame pump is commonly regarded to be a longer and more efficient version of the mini pump. You can think of it as a mix between the floor pump and the mini pump. The design and weight of a frame pump allow it to fit on the frame of a bicycle for easy carriage.

However, since it is longer and often comes with its own standing supports, you can easily generate more power with them. This enables you to pump more pressure into your bicycle tires and even fill them to full capacity when needed.

However, it is still recommended that you make use of a frame pump as a secondary option to the floor pump due to the higher convenience and durability of floor pumps.

## CO2 Inflator:

A CO2 inflator is not strictly a bicycle air pump but instead a mini inflator. This inflator is an incredibly lightweight option that offers a quick and simple fix for a flat tire. These inflators make use of a small valve ending (or pump head) and inflate the tire using a CO2 canister (or cartridge).

A CO2 cartridge will give you sufficient gas for filling a complete tire.

One advantage of making use of these pumps is that they are very lightweight and highly portable – most of them are so small that you can even carry them in your pockets. Another benefit is that these can provide instant inflation to the desired pressure which saves you from having to put in the effort of pumping air manually via a mini pump or frame pump.

However, the downside is that these inflators can prove to be quite expensive in the long run (since you need a new cartridge each time) and these only offer a temporary fix to the problem. This is the reason that we have not reviewed CO2 inflators in this article.

## What To Look For When Shopping for the Best MTB Bike Pump

Here are the features that you need to look for when you are choosing the best bike pump for your bicycle:

### Valve:

There are two types of bicycle valves: Presta and Schrader.

A Presta valve is a thin valve that has a removable inner core and is generally opened or closed through the use of tiny lock top. This valve is most commonly found in road bicycles and in the inner tubes of some mountain bicycles.

On the other hand, a Schrader value is much broader and it does not involve as much mechanics as the Presta valve since it has to be sealed (for opening and closing) with a simple plastic top. This valve is commonly found on mountain bikes.

When you are looking for the [best pump](https://cuinbed.com/best-penis-pump/), it is important to know which valve do your bicycle tires have and then choose the pump that is compatible with the relevant valve.

In most cases though, a bicycle tire pump will be compatible with both Presta and Schrader valves.

Floor pumps most usually offer two separate points for each kind of valve while mini pumps or frame pumps will require you to adjust the pump head for ensuring a good fit.

### Gauge:

The gauge is a small instrument that displays the PSI of the pump i.e. the pressure inside the tire.

When you are pumping air into your bicycle tires, it is important to know exactly what pressure are you looking to fill them to for ensuring a smooth cycling experience and in some extreme cases, for preventing the tires from bursting.

Therefore, to monitor the pressure inside the tire you will need a gauge on your pump.

Most of the best mountain bike floor pumps come with a gauge but it is less commonly found in mini pumps and frame pumps (since they are designed for portability).

Ideally, the best MTB bike pump should have a gauge that is accurate and has clear markings so that its reading can be easily understood.

### Pressure and Volume:

You will not always be requiring a mountain bike pump that has the highest-pressure capacity – in fact, you will never see yourself finding the need for a pump that has a capacity above 160 PSI in most cases. The reason is that a higher-pressure pump is a direct trade-off with the volume output and the gauge accuracy.  

A low-pressure pump means that you will be able to reach your desired pressure in fewer strokes while a high-pressure pump will require more strokes.

Whether you need a high-pressure pump or a low-pressure pump is directly dependent on your bicycle tires.

For instance, larger tires (such as those in mountain bikes) have a much greater volume than smaller tires and hence, you will need a low-pressure, large-volume pump for inflating them quickly and vice versa.

### Design and Construction:

The looks and more importantly, the style of the pump is also important – not just in terms of the aesthetics but in terms of usability and durability as well.

A good mountain bike pump should be able to last for several years without showing signs of wear and tear. The design and material that is used for the pumps are what define its durability.

Pumps that have a plastic construction are the least expensive but will usually be the least durable (and can break easily) while pumps with a metal construction tend to be much more durable but are much more expensive. You need to find the right balance between size, durability, and price to pick the right bicycle pump for you.

Similarly, the best MTB bike pump will have a handle that fits and feels perfect in your hands so that you can pump air easily and quickly. When you are buying a bicycle pump, it is important to keep in mind that a good bike pump will allow you to inflate the bicycle tires without tiring yourself out too quickly.

### Size and Weight:

If you are looking to purchase a floor pump that will be staying in your garage then the size and weight are not much of a concern and you should not bother with them.

However, if you are looking for a mini pump or a frame pump that can help you inflate a tire in time of emergencies then you need to pick a pump that is lightweight and is small enough to be carried around easily.

One key thing to remember here is that the smaller a pump, the lesser capacity it has. So, what you need to do is to look for a pump that is portable but has an adequate pumping capacity (according to your bike’s tires), as well.

## Conclusion:

According to our assessment, the Pro Bike Tool Mini Floor Bike Pump is the best MTB bike pump that is available today. This is because it offers the perfect balance between ease of use, durability, and portability which are the key features that you need to look for in a bicycle pump.
