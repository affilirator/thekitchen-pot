The brand new CamelBak HAWG NV 3L hydration pack is a much improved and refined version of its predecessor. It has been constructed with lighter materials and makes use of Camelbak’s new technologies such as the NVIS back panel.

> If you are wondering about CamelBak’s choice of name for the pack, H.A.W.G., it apparently stands for ‘holds a lot of water and gear’.

It’s true the HAWG NV holds 3 liters of water in the brand spanking new Antidote bladder and plenty of storage space, perhaps even enough for an overnight stay. Unfortunately, CamelBak doesn’t look like they spent a lot of time organizing the storage area.

If you enjoy nothing more than spending the entire day riding up and down mountainsides and tough terrains, you will definitely become good friends with the CamelBak HAWG NV 3L hydration pack. This pack does not just provide you with adequate hydration, it is capable of enhancing your ride, and once you have tried it out you’ll ever turn back.

#### Technical Details

- Fabric: 70D Diamond Claurus & 420D nylon with DWR + 1000mm PU CoatingvCargo Capacity: 19 vitresvBladder/Size: 3 litre Antidote reservoir with Quick Link system
- Helmet Holder: XC Helmet Carry
- Waist Strap: Wide 38mm/1.5″ strap with integrated cargo pockets
- Sternum Strap: Dynamic Suspension and slider sternum strap
- Back Panel: N.V.I.S
- Pocket 1: Fleece Lined Media Pocket
- Pocket 2: Hip Belt Pockets
- Pocket 3: Bike tool organizer pocket
- Rain Cover?: Removable Raincover with reflectivity
- Height: 17.5″ / 44cm
- Weight: 900g (excluding reservoir)

#### Features

There are so many features to talk about on the CamelBak HAWG NV 3L hydration pack because it includes the majority of CamelBak’s new technology. One of the major new additions is the N.V.I.S back panel which is designed to increase the circulation of air against your back and prevent sweaty back syndrome. The back panel really does work, it ventilates more efficiently than other packs, making the ride much more enjoyable and comfortable.

Another noticeable improvement is the inclusion of the Antidote reservoir with Quick link system; this bladder holds 3 liters of water, has a much lower profile and is 18% lighter than the Omega. The Antidote uses what’s known as a Baffle to ensure that the bladder remains flat inside the pack rather than bundling up into a sausage shape. The new bladder also features a large cap which is closed by a simple quarter turn action which makes refilling and cleaning so much easier.

The last thing I am going to praise the CamelBak HAWG NV 3L hydration pack for is the integrated rain cover which prevents your pack from getting wet and covered in mud. If you plan on heading out in all kinds of weathers you will find this addition a great help.

#### Usability

Riding across the unruliest terrains is not made any more difficult by carrying the HAWG NV, it is very easy to use and comfortable to wear. The N.V.I.S back panel, the six contact points, lighter weight and lower profile mean that in most cases you’ll even forget you are carrying it with you. The new technologies incorporated into the design of the HAWG, including the Antidote bladder, meaning it is far superior to its predecessor.

The main storage compartment of the CamelBak HAWG NV 3L hydration pack is the only real let down as it has not been well thought out. This large compartment is just that, one big large open storage area with no internal layout. This is a real shame because the pocket specifically designed for carrying tools is quite small so you may often have extras that you would like to tuck away in the main body of the pack. However, it is large enough to pack in everything you might need on an all-day mountain bike ride, including a lunch, first aid kit, waterproof jacket, kneepads, tools, extra water bottles, puncture repair kit, and so on.

#### Disadvantages

The only real complaint about the new HAWG is the lack of an internal layout inside the main compartment. It would be nice to have a couple of separate sections to keep bits and bobs without having to search through the entire pack. The price might also put off some buyers, but if you do fancy splashing out on a new hydration pack, this is definitely a great option.

#### Advantages

The CamelBak HAWG NV 3L hydration pack is excellent; the redesign and new technology means that it is far more comfortable and user-friendly that the last version. There is definitely enough storage space for a long ride.

The pack is incredibly comfortable, and the lightweight material helps make it even less bulky. The Antidote bladder is a huge bonus to anyone who has only ever worked with the older Omega reservoir, cleaning and refilling is now easier than ever before. The best price we could find it for is £95.99 from Wiggle Online Cycle Shop. Open the Wiggle Online Cycle Shop Online Store here to see this deal.

#### Features of the Camelbak Lobo Hydration Pack

The [Camelbak Lobo](https://mtbnz.com/recommends/camelbak-lobo/ "Camelbak Lobo") hydration pack has a number of great features which set this system apart from its rivals.

The second most important part of any hydration pack is the storage facilities, and the Camelbak Lobo does not disappoint. There are four zip pockets for cargo, one with a cable port, and all with additional netting for security and to prevent you having to fumble around for things. The 3.3 litre capacity should be enough for a day outside; there is space for a mobile phone, wallet, keys, repair kits or pumps, and a light rain jacket. However, the long narrow shape of the backpack can make it a little awkward if you are looking to pack something larger.

#### Advantages

The large 3 litre bladder in the Camelbak Lobo hydration pack is excellent as it is slightly bigger than the majority of other systems, meaning that sports enthusiasts can go for longer without having to refill. There are additional splash guard protectors on the pack to prevent mud and water getting to the pack on wet and windy days.

Another bonus is that the bladder is very low maintenance, it only needs a thorough wash around once a week, and is very easy to remove and refill.

#### The Verdict?

All in all, the [Camelbak Lobo](https://mtbnz.com/recommends/camelbak-lobo/ "Camelbak Lobo") is a high-quality pack that is perfect for those day rides.

#### Usability

![mountain bike hydration pack reviews](images/mountain-bike-hydration-pack-reviews-206x300.jpg)

The Camelbak Rogue hydration pack is very comfortable and does not weigh you down whatever you are doing. Mountain bike riders and hikers may find that their back heats up slightly on uphill climbs but the ventilation channels do their best to prevent this from happening. The valve on the bladder is very good as it has a bite valve combined with a right angle valve which means that there is even less chance of any leakage.

Filling the bladder up is easy enough as it has a very wide mouth, allowing you to fill it with ice too if you would prefer. It is a good idea to fill the bladder and place it in the backpack before filling the storage pockets to ensure that you have enough space for other items.

#### Features

This Camelbak Rogue hydration pack is fitted with the standard 2 litre bladder which if filled up to the maximum should be enough fluids to keep you going for 2-3 hours at least. As this backpack is not designed specifically for cargo, there is just the right amount of room for the essentials.

The first zipped pocket is high up, and the second, which also has a keyring clip and mesh divider, is towards the bottom. The zips are of a very high quality, and unlikely to work their way loose so your belongings should be as safe as houses. An open mesh pocket between the bottom pocket and the bladder is an ideal storage space for a larger item such as a waterproof jacket.

#### Summary

This hydration pack is made of very high quality materials so there cannot be any complaints on the standard of the manufacturing. What you plan to use the Camelback Rogue hydration pack for will depend on how useful you find the product to be, but it is perfect for riders, skaters, and hikers who need hands-free hydration on outings lasting no more than a few hours. The pack itself is very lightweight, with the bladder sitting comfortably on your back, and many will hardly even notice that it is there.
